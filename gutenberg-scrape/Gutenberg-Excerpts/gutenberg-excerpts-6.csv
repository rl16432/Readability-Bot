Pride and Prejudice,Jane Austen,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-h/1342-h.htm,"“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person’s whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.” “That will make your ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on me.” “In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere."
"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus",Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm,"The voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I could continue my journey. My father’s care and attentions were indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to seek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not abhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism."
Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,Lewis Carroll,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-h/11-h.htm,"Alice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the Duchess: you’d better ask her about it.” “She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.” And the executioner went off like an arrow. “You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!” said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice’s, and they walked off together. Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen."
The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,Arthur Conan Doyle,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661-h/1661-h.htm,"“Have they thought of looking outside the house?” “Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely examined.” “Now, my dear sir,” said Holmes, “is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered."
"Moby Dick; Or, The Whale",Herman Melville,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/2701-h/2701-h.htm,"“Mrs. Hussey,” said I, “he’s alive at all events; so leave us, if you please, and I will see to this strange affair myself.” Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon Queequeg to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could do—for all my polite arts and blandishments—he would not move a peg, nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in the slightest way. I went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage, as they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig, confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only); after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o’clock, I went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination."
The Prince,Niccolò Machiavelli,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1232/1232-h/1232-h.htm,"Other poems include Sonetti, Canzoni, Ottave, and Canti carnascialeschi. To the Magnificent Lorenzo Di Piero De’ Medici Those who strive to obtain the good graces of a prince are accustomed to come before him with such things as they hold most precious, or in which they see him take most delight; whence one often sees horses, arms, cloth of gold, precious stones, and similar ornaments presented to princes, worthy of their greatness. Desiring therefore to present myself to your Magnificence with some testimony of my devotion towards you, I have not found among my possessions anything which I hold more dear than, or value so much as, the knowledge of the actions of great men, acquired by long experience in contemporary affairs, and a continual study of antiquity; which, having reflected upon it with great and prolonged diligence, I now send, digested into a little volume, to your Magnificence."
Beowulf: An Anglo-Saxon Epic Poem,J. Lesslie Hall,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16328.html.images,"Where Hygd to him tendered treasure and kingdom, Rings and dominion: her son she not trusted, To be able to keep the kingdom devised him ’Gainst alien races, on the death of King Higelac. Yet the sad ones succeeded not in persuading the atheling In any way ever, to act as a suzerain To Heardred, or promise to govern the kingdom; Yet with friendly counsel in the folk he sustained him, Gracious, with honor, till he grew to be older, Wielded the Weders. Wide-fleeing outlaws, Ohthere’s sons, sought him o’er the waters: They had stirred a revolt ’gainst the helm of the Scylfings,"
The Picture of Dorian Gray,Oscar Wilde,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/174/174-h/174-h.htm,"“I believe he is in love,” cried Lady Narborough, “and that he is afraid to tell me for fear I should be jealous. He is quite right. I certainly should.” “Dear Lady Narborough,” murmured Dorian, smiling, “I have not been in love for a whole week—not, in fact, since Madame de Ferrol left town.” “How you men can fall in love with that woman!” exclaimed the old lady. “I really cannot understand it.” “It is simply because she remembers you when you were a little girl, Lady Narborough,” said Lord Henry. “She is the one link between us and your short frocks.”"
A Tale of Two Cities,Charles Dickens,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/98/98-h/98-h.htm,"“I said, couldn’t you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur’s information?” “It is a lady’s shoe. It is a young lady’s walking-shoe. It is in the present mode. I never saw the mode. I have had a pattern in my hand.” He glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride. “And the maker’s name?” said Defarge. Now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right hand in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded chin, and so on in regular changes, without a moment’s intermission."
The Great Gatsby,F. Scott Fitzgerald,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/64317.html.images,"“All right,” broke in Tom quickly, “I’m perfectly willing to go to town. Come on—we’re all going to town.” He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one moved. “Come on!” His temper cracked a little. “What’s the matter, anyhow? If we’re going to town, let’s start.” His hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale. Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive. “Are we just going to go?” she objected. “Like this? Aren’t we going to let anyone smoke a cigarette first?”"
The Scarlet Letter,Nathaniel Hawthorne,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25344/25344-h/25344-h.htm,"The scarlet letter had not done its office. Meanwhile, her mother had accosted the physician. “I would speak a word with you,” said she,—“a word that concerns us much.” “Aha! and is it Mistress Hester that has a word for old Roger Chillingworth?” answered he, raising himself from his stooping posture. “With all my heart! Why, Mistress, I hear good tidings of you on all hands! No longer ago than yester-eve, a magistrate, a wise and godly man, was discoursing of your affairs, Mistress Hester, and whispered me that there had been question concerning you in the council. It was debated whether or no, with safety to the common weal, yonder scarlet letter might be taken off your bosom."
Metamorphosis,Franz Kafka,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/5200/5200-h/5200-h.htm,"It was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow himself up a little and they fell off by themselves. But it became difficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but instead of them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in different directions, and which he was moreover unable to control. If he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully."
The Yellow Wallpaper,Charlotte Perkins Gilman,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1952/1952-h/1952-h.htm,"It is repeated, of course, by the breadths, but not otherwise. Looked at in one way each breadth stands alone, the bloated curves and flourishes—a kind of “debased Romanesque” with delirium tremens—go waddling up and down in isolated columns of fatuity. But, on the other hand, they connect diagonally, and the sprawling outlines run off in great slanting waves of optic horror, like a lot of wallowing seaweeds in full chase. The whole thing goes horizontally, too, at least it seems so, and I exhaust myself in trying to distinguish the order of its going in that direction. They have used a horizontal breadth for a frieze, and that adds wonderfully to the confusion."
Dracula,Bram Stoker,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/345/345-h/345-h.htm,"“25 September, 6 o’clock. “Dear Madam Mina,— “I have read your husband’s so wonderful diary. You may sleep without doubt. Strange and terrible as it is, it is true! I will pledge my life on it. It may be worse for others; but for him and you there is no dread. He is a noble fellow; and let me tell you from experience of men, that one who would do as he did in going down that wall and to that room—ay, and going a second time—is not one to be injured in permanence by a shock. His brain and his heart are all right; this I swear, before I have even seen him; so be at rest."
Grimms' Fairy Tales,Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2591/2591-h/2591-h.htm,"He found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than it really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense giant who stood in front of it. He thought to himself, ‘If the giant sees me going in, my life will not be worth much.’ However, after a while he summoned up courage and went forward. When the giant saw him, he called out, ‘It is lucky for that you have come, for I have not had anything to eat for a long time. I can have you now for my supper.’ would rather you let that alone,’ said the man, ‘for I do not willingly give myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to satisfy your hunger.’ ‘If that is so,’ replied the giant, will leave you in peace; I only thought of eating you because I had nothing else.’"
A Doll's House : a play,Henrik Ibsen,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2542/2542-h/2542-h.htm,"Yes, a wonderful thing!—But it is so terrible, Christine; it mustn’t happen, not for all the world. I will go at once and see Krogstad. Don’t go to him; he will do you some harm. There was a time when he would gladly do anything for my sake. He? Where does he live? Don’t be so frightened. We are not coming in; you have locked the door. Are you trying on your dress? Yes, that’s it. I look so nice, Torvald. Yes, but it’s no use. It is hopeless. The letter is lying there in the box."

Milton has emulated this passage, in describing the couch of our first parents:— —“Paradise Lost,” iv. 700. —He lies protected, “Paradise Lost,” vi. 335, seq. —For, by the gods! who flies. Observe the bold ellipsis of “he cries,” and the transition from the direct to the oblique construction."
Jane Eyre: An Autobiography,Charlotte Brontë,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1260/1260-h/1260-h.htm,"“I am. God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide. Moreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will know for certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it than by leaving it.” “What do you mean?” “It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by some means that doubt is removed.” “I know where your heart turns and to what it clings."
"Walden, and On The Duty Of Civil Disobedience",Henry David Thoreau,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/205/205-h/205-h.htm,"Now the trunks of trees on the bottom, and the old log canoe, and the dark surrounding woods, are gone, and the villagers, who scarcely know where it lies, instead of going to the pond to bathe or drink, are thinking to bring its water, which should be as sacred as the Ganges at least, to the village in a pipe, to wash their dishes with!—to earn their Walden by the turning of a cock or drawing of a plug! That devilish Iron Horse, whose ear-rending neigh is heard throughout the town, has muddied the Boiling Spring with his foot, and he it is that has browsed off all the woods on Walden shore, that Trojan horse, with a thousand men in his belly, introduced by mercenary Greeks! Where is the country’s champion, the Moore of Moore Hill, to meet him at the Deep Cut and thrust an avenging lance between the ribs of the bloated pest?"
A Modest Proposal,Jonathan Swift,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1080/1080-h/1080-h.htm,"For first, as I have already observed, it would greatly lessen the number of Papists, with whom we are yearly overrun, being the principal breeders of the nation, as well as our most dangerous enemies, and who stay at home on purpose with a design to deliver the kingdom to the Pretender, hoping to take their advantage by the absence of so many good Protestants, who have chosen rather to leave their country, than stay at home and pay tithes against their conscience to an episcopal curate. Secondly, The poorer tenants will have something valuable of their own, which by law may be made liable to a distress, and help to pay their landlord’s rent, their corn and cattle being already seized, and money a thing unknown."
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,Robert Louis Stevenson,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/43/43-h/43-h.htm,"“Jekyll, for instance,” said the lawyer. “He never told you,” cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. “I did not think you would have lied.” “Come,” said Mr. Utterson, “that is not fitting language.” The other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment, with extraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and disappeared into the house. The lawyer stood awhile when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture of disquietude. Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing every step or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mental perplexity. The problem he was thus debating as he walked, was one of a class that is rarely solved."
War and Peace,graf Leo Tolstoy,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2600/2600-h/2600-h.htm,"“But military men have told me that it is impossible to fight in the town,” said Pierre, “and that the position...” “Well, of course! That’s what we were saying,” replied the first speaker. “And what does he mean by ‘One of my eyes was sore but now I am on the lookout with both’?” asked Pierre. “The count had a sty,” replied the adjutant smiling, “and was very much upset when I told him people had come to ask what was the matter with him. By the by, Count,” he added suddenly, addressing Pierre with a smile, “we heard that you have family troubles and that the countess, your wife...”"
"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Complete",Mark Twain,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/74/74-h/74-h.htm,"“I was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it did do you good.” Tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping through his gravity. “I know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter. It done him good, too. I never see him get around so since—” “Oh, go ’long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And you try and see if you can’t be a good boy, for once, and you needn’t take any more medicine.” Tom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange thing had been occurring every day latterly."
Anthem,Ayn Rand,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1250/1250-h/1250-h.htm,"“You have worked on this alone?” asked International 1-5537. “Many men in the Homes of the Scholars have had strange new ideas in the past,” said Solidarity 8-1164, “but when the majority of their brother Scholars voted against them, they abandoned their ideas, as all men must.” “This box is useless,” said Alliance 6-7349. “This would wreck the Plans of the World Council,” said Unanimity 2-9913, “and without the Plans of the World Council the sun cannot rise. It took fifty years to secure the approval of all the Councils for the Candle, and to decide upon the number needed, and to re-fit the Plans so as to make candles instead of torches."

There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge’s name was good upon ’Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail. Scrooge never painted out Old Marley’s name. There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names."
The Republic,Plato,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1497.html.images,"Exactly so. And is not that the best-ordered State in which the greatest number of persons apply the terms ‘mine’ and ‘not mine’ in the same way to the same thing? Quite true. Very true, he replied; and I agree with you that in the best-ordered State there is the nearest approach to this common feeling which you describe. Then when any one of the citizens experiences any good or evil, the whole State will make his case their own, and will either rejoice or sorrow with him? Yes, he said, that is what will happen in a well-ordered State."
Crime and Punishment,Fyodor Dostoyevsky,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2554/2554-h/2554-h.htm,"“A priest,” he articulated huskily. Katerina Ivanovna walked to the window, laid her head against the window frame and exclaimed in despair: “Oh, cursed life!” “A priest,” the dying man said again after a moment’s silence. “They’ve gone for him,” Katerina Ivanovna shouted to him, he obeyed her shout and was silent. With sad and timid eyes he looked for her; she returned and stood by his pillow. He seemed a little easier but not for long. Soon his eyes rested on little Lida, his favourite, who was shaking in the corner, as though she were in a fit, and staring at him with her wondering childish eyes."
Heart of Darkness,Joseph Conrad,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/219/219-h/219-h.htm,"“She came abreast of the steamer, stood still, and faced us. Her long shadow fell to the water’s edge. Her face had a tragic and fierce aspect of wild sorrow and of dumb pain mingled with the fear of some struggling, half-shaped resolve. She stood looking at us without a stir, and like the wilderness itself, with an air of brooding over an inscrutable purpose. A whole minute passed, and then she made a step forward. There was a low jingle, a glint of yellow metal, a sway of fringed draperies, and she stopped as if her heart had failed her."
Great Expectations,Charles Dickens,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1400/1400-h/1400-h.htm,"“This is a fine place of my son’s, sir,” cried the old man, while I nodded as hard as I possibly could. “This is a pretty pleasure-ground, sir. This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept together by the Nation, after my son’s time, for the people’s enjoyment.” “You’re as proud of it as Punch; ain’t you, Aged?” said Wemmick, contemplating the old man, with his hard face really softened; “there’s a nod for you;” giving him a tremendous one; “there’s another for you;” giving him a still more tremendous one; “you like that, don’t you? If you’re not tired, Mr. Pip—though I know it’s tiring to strangers—will you tip him one more? You can’t think how it pleases him.”"
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,Mark Twain,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/76/76-h/76-h.htm,"When I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a piece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and tugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces, and got away as quick as I could. I cried a little when I was covering up Buck’s face, for he was mighty good to me. It was just dark now. I never went near the house, but struck through the woods and made for the swamp. Jim warn’t on his island, so I tramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows, red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country."
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,L. Frank Baum,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55/55-h/55-h.htm,"“Thank you,” he answered. “Now, if you will help me sew the silk together, we will begin to work on our balloon.” So Dorothy took a needle and thread, and as fast as Oz cut the strips of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together. First there was a strip of light green silk, then a strip of dark green and then a strip of emerald green; for Oz had a fancy to make the balloon in different shades of the color about them. It took three days to sew all the strips together, but when it was finished they had a big bag of green silk more than twenty feet long."
"The Count of Monte Cristo, Illustrated",Alexandre Dumas,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1184/1184-h/1184-h.htm,"The morning’s sun rose clear and resplendent, touching the foamy waves into a network of ruby-tinted light. Various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the Pharaon had promised to attend the nuptial feast; but all seemed unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could possibly be intended. Danglars, however, who now made his appearance, accompanied by Caderousse, effectually confirmed the report, stating that he had recently conversed with Morrel, who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at La Réserve. In fact, a moment later Morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the Pharaon, who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship; and as Dantès was universally beloved on board his vessel, the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own."

Do you believe your own theory? —No, Stephen said promptly. —Are you going to write it? Mr Best asked. You ought to make it a dialogue, don’t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote. John Eclecticon doubly smiled. —Well, in that case, he said, I don’t see why you should expect payment for it since you don’t believe it yourself."
The Odyssey,Homer,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1727/1727-h/1727-h.htm,"His son, Theoclymenus, it was who now came up to Telemachus as he was making drink-offerings and praying in his ship. “Friend,” said he, “now that I find you sacrificing in this place, I beseech you by your sacrifices themselves, and by the god to whom you make them, I pray you also by your own head and by those of your followers tell me the truth and nothing but the truth. Who and whence are you? Tell me also of your town and parents.” Telemachus said, “I will answer you quite truly. I am from Ithaca, and my father is Ulysses, as surely as that he ever lived."
The Prophet,Kahlil Gibran,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/58585/58585-h/58585-h.htm,"You have been told that, even like a chain, you are as weak as your weakest link. This is but half the truth. You are also as strong as your strongest link. To measure you by your smallest deed is to reckon the power of ocean by the frailty of its foam. To judge you by your failures is to cast blame upon the seasons for their inconstancy. Ay, you are like an ocean, And though heavy-grounded ships await the tide upon your shores, yet, even like an ocean, you cannot hasten your tides. And like the seasons you are also,"
Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/514/514-h/514-h.htm,"""That reminds me,"" said Meg, ""that I've got something to tell. It isn't funny, like Jo's story, but I thought about it a good deal as I came home. At the Kings' today I found everybody in a flurry, and one of the children said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful, and Papa had sent him away. I heard Mrs. King crying and Mr. King talking very loud, and Grace and Ellen turned away their faces when they passed me, so I shouldn't see how red and swollen their eyes were. I didn't ask any questions, of course, but I felt so sorry for them and was rather glad I hadn't any wild brothers to do wicked things and disgrace the family."""
Peter Pan,J. M. Barrie,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16/16-h/16-h.htm,"But he was far too proud for that. “If you find your mothers,” he said darkly, “I hope you will like them.” The awful cynicism of this made an uncomfortable impression, and most of them began to look rather doubtful. After all, their faces said, were they not noodles to want to go? “Now then,” cried Peter, “no fuss, no blubbering; good-bye, Wendy;” and he held out his hand cheerily, quite as if they must really go now, for he had something important to do. She had to take his hand, and there was no indication that he would prefer a thimble."
Anne of Green Gables,L. M. Montgomery,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/45/45-h/45-h.htm,"“Now, Anne, I noticed last night that you threw your clothes all about the floor when you took them off. That is a very untidy habit, and I can’t allow it at all. As soon as you take off any article of clothing fold it neatly and place it on the chair. I haven’t any use at all for little girls who aren’t neat.” “I was so harrowed up in my mind last night that I didn’t think about my clothes at all,” said Anne. “I’ll fold them nicely tonight. They always made us do that at the asylum. Half the time, though, I’d forget, I’d be in such a hurry to get into bed nice and quiet and imagine things.”"
"The Happy Prince, and Other Tales",Oscar Wilde,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/902.html.images,"“A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other people’s toes,” answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; and the Cracker nearly exploded with laughter. “Pray, what are you laughing at?” inquired the Rocket; “I am not laughing.” “I am laughing because I am happy,” replied the Cracker. “That is a very selfish reason,” said the Rocket angrily. “What right have you to be happy? You should be thinking about others. In fact, you should be thinking about me. I am always thinking about myself, and I expect everybody else to do the same. That is what is called sympathy."

In fact, as far as I can make out, the poachers are the only people who make anything out of it. A country house! How many bedrooms? Well, that point can be cleared up afterwards. You have a town house, I hope? A girl with a simple, unspoiled nature, like Gwendolen, could hardly be expected to reside in the country. Well, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but it is let by the year to Lady Bloxham. Of course, I can get it back whenever I like, at six months’ notice."
The Souls of Black Folk,W. E. B. Du Bois,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/408/408-h/408-h.htm,"Such was the dawn of Freedom; such was the work of the Freedmen’s Bureau, which, summed up in brief, may be epitomized thus: for some fifteen million dollars, beside the sums spent before 1865, and the dole of benevolent societies, this Bureau set going a system of free labor, established a beginning of peasant proprietorship, secured the recognition of black freedmen before courts of law, and founded the free common school in the South. On the other hand, it failed to begin the establishment of good-will between ex-masters and freedmen, to guard its work wholly from paternalistic methods which discouraged self-reliance, and to carry out to any considerable extent its implied promises to furnish the freedmen with land."
The American Diary of a Japanese Girl,Yoné Noguchi,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/63256.html.images,"12th—It surprises me to learn that many an American is born and dies in a hotel. Such a life—however large rooms you may possess—is not distinguishable, in my opinion, from that of a bird in a cage. Is hotel-living a recent fashion? Don’t say so! The business locality—like the place where this Palace Hotel takes its seat—does not afford a stomachful of respectable air. I preferred some hospitable boarding house in a quiet street, where I might even step up and down in nude feet. I wished to occupy a chamber where the morning sun could steal in and shake my sleepy little head with golden fingers as my beloved mama might do."
"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave",Douglass,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/23/23-h/23-h.htm,"My mistress was, as I have said, a kind and tender-hearted woman; and in the simplicity of her soul she commenced, when I first went to live with her, to treat me as she supposed one human being ought to treat another. In entering upon the duties of a slaveholder, she did not seem to perceive that I sustained to her the relation of a mere chattel, and that for her to treat me as a human being was not only wrong, but dangerously so. Slavery proved as injurious to her as it did to me. When I went there, she was a pious, warm, and tender-hearted woman."
A Study in Scarlet,Arthur Conan Doyle,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/244/244-h/244-h.htm,"The young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure. “I’ll do so,” he said, “we’ve been in the mountains for two months, and are not over and above in visiting condition. He must take us as he finds us.” “He has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I,” she answered, “he’s awful fond of me. If those cows had jumped on me he’d have never got over it.” “Neither would I,” said her companion. “You! Well, I don’t see that it would make much matter to you, anyhow. You ain’t even a friend of ours.”"
The War of the Worlds,H. G. Wells,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/36/36-h/36-h.htm,"The officers who were not actively engaged stood and stared over the treetops southwestward, and the men digging would stop every now and again to stare in the same direction. Byfleet was in a tumult; people packing, and a score of hussars, some of them dismounted, some on horseback, were hunting them about. Three or four black government waggons, with crosses in white circles, and an old omnibus, among other vehicles, were being loaded in the village street. There were scores of people, most of them sufficiently sabbatical to have assumed their best clothes. The soldiers were having the greatest difficulty in making them realise the gravity of their position."
Don Quixote,Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/996/996-h/996-h.htm,"“I will hold my peace, señora,” said Don Quixote, “and I will curb the natural anger that had arisen in my breast, and will proceed in peace and quietness until I have fulfilled my promise; but in return for this consideration I entreat you to tell me, if you have no objection to do so, what is the nature of your trouble, and how many, who, and what are the persons of whom I am to require due satisfaction, and on whom I am to take vengeance on your behalf?” “That I will do with all my heart,” replied Dorothea, “if it will not be wearisome to you to hear of miseries and misfortunes.”"
The Hound of the Baskervilles,Arthur Conan Doyle,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2852/2852-h/2852-h.htm,“I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised in town before going to the country.” “I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look at it in this light. On what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be made? When would his friends unite to give him a pledge of their good will? Obviously at the moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start a practice for himself. We know there has been a presentation. We believe there has been a change from a town hospital to a country practice.

They need looking after, like any other class of persons that you employ. Suppose I didn’t look after the clerks in my office, just let them run things their own way; they’d soon make a nice mess of me and my business.” “Where are you going?” asked Edna, seeing that her husband arose from table without having eaten a morsel except a taste of the highly-seasoned soup. “I’m going to get my dinner at the club. Good night.” He went into the hall, took his hat and stick from the stand, and left the house."

He used to continue long at it, making me spend two or three times before he did, and then when he felt it coming he used to withdraw, and his prick being all moist, he would slip it into my bottom, and spend there as soon as ever he got the head of it inside.” “And did that give you any pleasure, mamma?”"

Come, and sit by me. I was sure you wouldn’t break your word, and I’ll make you promise again, before you go.’ “I knew now that I mustn’t tease him, as he was ill; and I spoke softly and put no questions, and avoided irritating him in any way. I had brought some of my nicest books for him: he asked me to read a little of one, and I was about to comply, when Earnshaw burst the door open: having gathered venom with reflection."

Him that wants shall get it. Have I lived this many years, and a son of a rum puncheon cock his hat athwart my hawse at the latter end of it? You know the way; you’re all gentlemen o’ fortune, by your account. Well, I’m ready. Take a cutlass, him that dares, and I’ll see the colour of his inside, crutch and all, before that pipe’s empty.”"
Leviathan,Thomas Hobbes,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3207/3207-h/3207-h.htm,"And because all signes of hatred, or contempt, provoke to fight; insomuch as most men choose rather to hazard their life, than not to be revenged; we may in the eighth place, for a Law of Nature set down this Precept, “That no man by deed, word, countenance, or gesture, declare Hatred, or Contempt of another.” The breach of which Law, is commonly called Contumely. The question who is the better man, has no place in the condition of meer Nature; where, (as has been shewn before,) all men are equall. The inequallity that now is, has been introduced by the Lawes civill."
The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana,Vatsyayana,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/27827/27827-h/27827-h.htm,"(a). When by living with a great man a courtesan acquires present wealth, and in addition to this becomes acquainted with other people, and thus obtains a chance of future fortune, and an accession of wealth, and becomes desirable to all, this is called a gain of wealth attended by other gain. (b). When by living with a man a courtesan simply gets money, this is called a gain of wealth not attended by any other gain. (c). When a courtesan receives money from other people besides her lover, the results are: the chance of the loss of future good from her present lover; the chance of disaffection of a man securely attached to her; the hatred of all; and the chance of a union with some low person, tending to destroy her future good."
Narrative of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson,Rowlandson,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/851/851-h/851-h.htm,"We took up our packs and along we went, but a wearisome day I had of it. As we went along I saw an Englishman stripped naked, and lying dead upon the ground, but knew not who it was. Then we came to another Indian town, where we stayed all night. In this town there were four English children, captives; and one of them my own sister's. I went to see how she did, and she was well, considering her captive condition. I would have tarried that night with her, but they that owned her would not suffer it. Then I went into another wigwam, where they were boiling corn and beans, which was a lovely sight to see, but I could not get a taste thereof."
Second Treatise of Government,John Locke,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7370.html.images,"First, It is not, nor can possibly be absolutely arbitrary over the lives and fortunes of the people: for it being but the joint power of every member of the society given up to that person, or assembly, which is legislator; it can be no more than those persons had in a state of nature before they entered into society, and gave up to the community: for no body can transfer to another more power than he has in himself; and no body has an absolute arbitrary power over himself, or over any other, to destroy his own life, or take away the life or property of another."
Emma,Jane Austen,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/158/158-h/158-h.htm,"“I shall hear about you all,” said he; “that is my chief consolation. I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you. I have engaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with me. She has been so kind as to promise it. Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when one is really interested in the absent!—she will tell me every thing. In her letters I shall be at dear Highbury again.” It was a sad change. They had been meeting almost every day since his arrival. Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks—indescribable spirit; the idea, the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought, the assurance of his attentions, his liveliness, his manners! It had been a very happy fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of Hartfield days."
The Time Machine,H. G. Wells,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/35/35-h/35-h.htm,"“I think so,” murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows, he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who repeats mystic words. “Yes, I think I see it now,” he said after some time, brightening in a quite transitory manner. “Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. For instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at fifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All these are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional representations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and unalterable thing."

They turned into the crossroad; the way became frightfully bad; the cart lurched from one rut to the other; he said to the postilion:— “Keep at a trot, and you shall have a double fee.” In one of the jolts, the whiffle-tree broke. “There’s the whiffle-tree broken, sir,” said the postilion; “I don’t know how to harness my horse now; this road is very bad at night; if you wish to return and sleep at Tinques, we could be in Arras early to-morrow morning.” He replied, “Have you a bit of rope and a knife?”"

Why? Do you know it?” “The Lass of Aughrim,” she repeated. “I couldn’t think of the name.” “It’s a very nice air,” said Mary Jane. “I’m sorry you were not in voice tonight.” “Now, Mary Jane,” said Aunt Kate, “don’t annoy Mr D’Arcy. I won’t have him annoyed.” Seeing that all were ready to start she shepherded them to the door, where good-night was said: “Well, good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks for the pleasant evening.”"
The Call of the Wild,Jack London,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/215/215-h/215-h.htm,"By afternoon, Perrault, who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his despatches, returned with two more dogs. “Billee” and “Joe” he called them, two brothers, and true huskies both. Sons of the one mother though they were, they were as different as day and night. Billee’s one fault was his excessive good nature, while Joe was the very opposite, sour and introspective, with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye. Buck received them in comradely fashion, Dave ignored them, while Spitz proceeded to thrash first one and then the other. Billee wagged his tail appeasingly, turned to run when he saw that appeasement was of no avail, and cried (still appeasingly) when Spitz’s sharp teeth scored his flank."
Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin,Benjamin Franklin,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/20203/20203-h/20203-h.htm,"I now open'd a little stationer's shop. I had in it blanks of all sorts, the correctest that ever appear'd among us, being assisted in that by my friend Breintnal. I had also paper, parchment, chapmen's books, etc. One Whitemash, a compositor I had known in London, an excellent workman, now came to me, and work'd with me constantly and diligently; and I took an apprentice, the son of Aquilla Rose. Whether this was a real change of sentiment or only artifice, on a supposition of our being too far engaged in affection to retract, and therefore that we should steal a marriage, which would leave them at liberty to give or withhold what they pleas'd, I know not; but I suspected the latter, resented it, and went no more."
Uncle Tom's Cabin,Harriet Beecher Stowe,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/203/203-h/203-h.htm,"“Mamma, couldn’t I take care of you one night—just one? I know I shouldn’t make you nervous, and I shouldn’t sleep. I often lie awake nights, thinking—” nonsense, child—nonsense!” said Marie; “you are such a strange child!” “But may I, mamma? I think,” she said, timidly, “that Mammy isn’t well. She told me her head ached all the time, lately.” that’s just one of Mammy’s fidgets! Mammy is just like all the rest of them—makes such a fuss about every little headache or finger-ache; it’ll never do to encourage it—never! I’m principled about this matter,” said she, turning to Miss Ophelia; “you’ll find the necessity of it."
The Brothers Karamazov,Fyodor Dostoyevsky,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/28054/28054-h/28054-h.htm,"They talk of hell fire in the material sense. I don’t go into that mystery and I shun it. But I think if there were fire in material sense, they would be glad of it, for I imagine that in material agony, their still greater spiritual agony would be forgotten for a moment. Moreover, that spiritual agony cannot be taken from them, for that suffering is not external but within them. And if it could be taken from them, I think it would be bitterer still for the unhappy creatures. For even if the righteous in Paradise forgave them, beholding their torments, and called them up to heaven in their infinite love, they would only multiply their torments, for they would arouse in them still more keenly a flaming thirst for responsive, active and grateful love which is now impossible."

I am, My Lord, Your Lordship's Humble and obedient servant, With these letters, I waited on the Bishop by the Governor's desire, and presented them to his Lordship. He received me with much condescension and politeness; but, from some certain scruples of delicacy, declined to ordain me."
The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,Washington Irving,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/41/41-h/41-h.htm,"The story-teller, who was just putting a glass of wine to his lips, as a refreshment after his toils, paused for a moment, looked at his inquirer with an air of infinite deference, and, lowering the glass slowly to the table, observed that the story was intended most logically to prove-- “That there is no situation in life but has its advantages and pleasures--provided we will but take a joke as we find it: “That, therefore, he that runs races with goblin troopers is likely to have rough riding of it. “Ergo, for a country schoolmaster to be refused the hand of a Dutch heiress is a certain step to high preferment in the state.”"
The Secret Garden,Frances Hodgson Burnett,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/113/113-h/113-h.htm,"Mistress Mary went a step nearer to the robin and looked at him very hard. “I’m lonely,” she said. She had not known before that this was one of the things which made her feel sour and cross. She seemed to find it out when the robin looked at her and she looked at the robin. The old gardener pushed his cap back on his bald head and stared at her a minute. “Art tha’ th’ little wench from India?” he asked. Mary nodded. “Then no wonder tha’rt lonely. Tha’lt be lonlier before tha’s done,” he said. He began to dig again, driving his spade deep into the rich black garden soil while the robin hopped about very busily employed."

But indeed few of them extend even to that length. They are expressed in the most plain and simple terms, wherein those people are not mercurial enough to discover above one interpretation: and to write a comment upon any law, is a capital crime. As to the decision of civil causes, or proceedings against criminals, their precedents are so few, that they have little reason to boast of any extraordinary skill in either. As to their military affairs, they boast that the king’s army consists of a hundred and seventy-six thousand foot, and thirty-two thousand horse: if that may be called an army, which is made up of tradesmen in the several cities, and farmers in the country, whose commanders are only the nobility and gentry, without pay or reward."

The Problems of Philosophy,Bertrand Russell,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/5827/5827-h/5827-h.htm,"Before taking up the general question of the nature of ideas, we must disentangle two entirely separate questions which arise concerning sense-data and physical objects. We saw that, for various reasons of detail, Berkeley was right in treating the sense-data which constitute our perception of the tree as more or less subjective, in the sense that they depend upon us as much as upon the tree, and would not exist if the tree were not being perceived. But this is an entirely different point from the one by which Berkeley seeks to prove that whatever can be immediately known must be in a mind."

Plutarch’s way, by how much it is more disdainful and farther stretched, is, in my opinion, so much more manly and persuasive: and I am apt to believe that his soul had more assured and more regular motions. The one more sharp, pricks and makes us start, and more touches the soul; the other more constantly solid, forms, establishes, and supports us, and more touches the understanding. That ravishes the judgment, this wins it. I have likewise seen other writings, yet more reverenced than these, that in the representation of the conflict they maintain against the temptations of the flesh, paint them, so sharp, so powerful and invincible, that we ourselves, who are of the common herd, are as much to wonder at the strangeness and unknown force of their temptation, as at the resisting it."

Did we reach any goals?” Govinda answered: “We have learned, and we’ll continue learning. You’ll be a great Samana, Siddhartha. Quickly, you’ve learned every exercise, often the old Samanas have admired you. One day, you’ll be a holy man, oh Siddhartha.”"

The tendency of a person to allow himself to be degraded, robbed, deceived, and exploited might be the diffidence of a God among men. 67. Love to one only is a barbarity, for it is exercised at the expense of all others. Love to God also! 68. ""I did that,"" says my memory. ""I could not have done that,"" says my pride, and remains inexorable. Eventually—the memory yields. 69. One has regarded life carelessly, if one has failed to see the hand that—kills with leniency. 70. If a man has character, he has also his typical experience, which always recurs."

It was that night that I found the clue to Ethan Frome, and began to put together this vision of his story. The village lay under two feet of snow, with drifts at the windy corners. In a sky of iron the points of the Dipper hung like icicles and Orion flashed his cold fires. The moon had set, but the night was so transparent that the white house-fronts between the elms looked gray against the snow, clumps of bushes made black stains on it, and the basement windows of the church sent shafts of yellow light far across the endless undulations."

Arter I was locked up for the night, the row and din outside made the thundering old jail so silent, that I could almost have beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door.” “Poor fellow!” said Nancy, who still had her face turned towards the quarter in which the bell had sounded. “Oh, Bill, such fine young chaps as them!” “Yes; that’s all you women think of,” answered Sikes. “Fine young chaps! Well, they’re as good as dead, so it don’t much matter.”"
The Mysterious Affair at Styles,Agatha Christie,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/863/863-h/863-h.htm,"Poirot nodded thoughtfully. “Then he is very sure. Well, that simplifies matters for us.” We went up together to the room of the tragedy. For convenience I append a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in it. Poirot locked the door on the inside, and proceeded to a minute inspection of the room. He darted from one object to the other with the agility of a grasshopper. I remained by the door, fearing to obliterate any clues. Poirot, however, did not seem grateful to me for my forbearance. “What have you, my friend,” he cried, “that you remain there like—how do you say it?—ah, yes, the stuck pig?”"
Thus Spake Zarathustra: A Book for All and None,Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1998/1998-h/1998-h.htm,"It despiseth also all bitter-sweet wisdom: for verily, there is also wisdom that bloometh in the dark, a night-shade wisdom, which ever sigheth: “All is vain!” Shy distrust is regarded by it as base, and every one who wanteth oaths instead of looks and hands: also all over-distrustful wisdom,—for such is the mode of cowardly souls. Baser still it regardeth the obsequious, doggish one, who immediately lieth on his back, the submissive one; and there is also wisdom that is submissive, and doggish, and pious, and obsequious. Hateful to it altogether, and a loathing, is he who will never defend himself, he who swalloweth down poisonous spittle and bad looks, the all-too-patient one, the all-endurer, the all-satisfied one: for that is the mode of slaves."
Old Granny Fox,Thornton W. Burgess,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4980/4980-h/4980-h.htm,"It was hard going for Granny and Reddy Fox. The snow was soft and deep in many places, and they had to keep pretty close to those places where rough Brother North Wind had blown away enough of the snow to make walking fairly easy. They soon found that their hope that they would find some of their neighbors too weak to escape was quite in vain. When jolly, round, red Mr. Sun dropped clown behind the Purple Hills to go to bed, their stomachs were quite as empty as when they had started out. “We'll go down to the Old Briar-patch. I don't believe it will be of much use, but you never can tell until you try."

However, I told him at once what my salary was. I turned horribly red. ""It is not very handsome,"" Zverkov observed majestically. ""Yes, you can't afford to dine at cafes on that,"" Ferfitchkin added insolently. ""To my thinking it's very poor,"" Trudolyubov observed gravely. ""And how thin you have grown! How you have changed!"" added Zverkov, with a shade of venom in his voice, scanning me and my attire with a sort of insolent compassion. ""Oh, spare his blushes,"" cried Ferfitchkin, sniggering. ""My dear sir, allow me to tell you I am not blushing,"" I broke out at last; ""do you hear? I am dining here, at this cafe, at my own expense, not at other people's--note that, Mr. Ferfitchkin."""
"Songs of Innocence, and Songs of Experience",William Blake,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1934/1934-h/1934-h.htm,"My mother taught me underneath a tree, And, sitting down before the heat of day, She took me on her lap and kissèd me, And, pointing to the East, began to say: ‘Look on the rising sun: there God does live, And gives His light, and gives His heat away, And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive Comfort in morning, joy in the noonday. ‘And we are put on earth a little space, That we may learn to bear the beams of love; And these black bodies and this sunburnt face Are but a cloud, and like a shady grove."

But soon a sight appear'd, Which, so intent to mark it, held me fix'd, That of confession I no longer thought. As in a quiet and clear lake the fish, If aught approach them from without, do draw Towards it, deeming it their food; so drew Full more than thousand splendours towards us, And in each one was heard: ""Lo! one arriv'd To multiply our loves!"" and as each came The shadow, streaming forth effulgence new, Witness'd augmented joy."

We have neither of us any thing to tell; you, because you do not communicate, and I, because I conceal nothing.” “I thought you were both in Devonshire,” said he. “Did you?” replied Elinor. “When do you go back again?” “I do not know.” And thus ended their discourse. Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life, as she was that evening, and never so much fatigued by the exercise."

First. Because it will come to that one time or other. Secondly. Because, the longer it is delayed the harder it will be to accomplish. The reader will pardon this digression, as it does not properly come under the head I first set out with, and to which I again return by the following position, viz. Should affairs be patched up with Britain, and she to remain the governing and sovereign power of America, (which, as matters are now circumstanced, is giving up the point intirely) we shall deprive ourselves of the very means of sinking the debt we have, or may contract."

For what did heaven and earth, which Thou madest in the Beginning, deserve of Thee? Let those spiritual and corporeal natures which Thou madest in Thy Wisdom, say wherein they deserved of Thee, to depend thereon (even in that their several inchoate and formless state, whether spiritual or corporeal, ready to fall away into an immoderate liberty and far-distant unlikeliness unto Thee;—the spiritual, though without form, superior to the corporeal though formed, and the corporeal though without form, better than were it altogether nothing), and so to depend upon Thy Word, as formless, unless by the same Word they were brought back to Thy Unity, indued with form and from Thee the One Sovereign Good were made all very good."

On the day that you take up your command, block the frontier passes, destroy the official tallies, and stop the passage of all emissaries. 64. Be stern in the council-chamber, so that you may control the situation. 65. If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in. 66. Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear, and subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground. 67. Walk in the path defined by rule, and accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive battle. 68. At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until the enemy gives you an opening; afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running hare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you."

I have been acquainted with you by character many years. Your person, your disposition, accomplishments, manner; they were all present to me."" Mr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise. No one can withstand the charm of such a mystery. To have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people, is irresistible; and Anne was all curiosity. She wondered, and questioned him eagerly; but in vain. He delighted in being asked, but he would not tell."

Customs are modified in course of time, fashions succeed one another, but such variations are taken no account of in the placid family circle where traditional usages prevail year after year. And if some scandalous episode or other occurs in the neighborhood, the disreputable story dies a natural death when it reaches the threshold of the house. The father and mother may, perhaps, exchange a few words on the subject when alone together some evening, but they speak in hushed tones—for even walls have ears."

Jurgis turned away, and then in a sudden rush the full realization of his triumph swept over him, and he gave a yell and a jump, and started off on a run. He had a job! He had a job! And he went all the way home as if upon wings, and burst into the house like a cyclone, to the rage of the numerous lodgers who had just turned in for their daily sleep."

Formal quotations, cited as documentary evidence, are introduced by a colon and enclosed in quotation marks. The provision of the Constitution is: “No tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state.” Quotations grammatically in apposition or the direct objects of verbs are preceded by a comma and enclosed in quotation marks. I recall the maxim of La Rochefoucauld, “Gratitude is a lively sense of benefits to come.” Aristotle says, “Art is an imitation of nature.” Quotations of an entire line, or more, of verse, are begun on a fresh line and centered, but need not be enclosed in quotation marks."

America with all your host, Lord Dexter in a bumper toast; May he enjoy his life in peace, And when he's dead his name not cease. In heaven may he always reign, For there's no sorrow, sin, nor pain: Unto the world I leave the rest, For to pronounce Lord Dexter blest."
