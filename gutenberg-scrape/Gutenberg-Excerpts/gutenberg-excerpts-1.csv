Pride and Prejudice,Jane Austen,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-h/1342-h.htm,"“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however, she added, “Very well; if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, “There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar with—‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’—and I shall keep mine to swell my song.”"
"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus",Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm,"In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably advanced. I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom. I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it."
Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,Lewis Carroll,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-h/11-h.htm,"“Well, I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn’t mind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.” “It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high). “But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she thought of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily offended!” “You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again. This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again."
The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,Arthur Conan Doyle,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661-h/1661-h.htm,"“My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson’s army, and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them."
"Moby Dick; Or, The Whale",Herman Melville,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/2701-h/2701-h.htm,"Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod’s quarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own white wake. “Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw,” murmured Starbuck to himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail. “God keep us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the inside wet my flesh. I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him!” “Stand by to sway me up!” cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket."
The Prince,Niccolò Machiavelli,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1232/1232-h/1232-h.htm,"And there is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality, for even whilst you exercise it you lose the power to do so, and so become either poor or despised, or else, in avoiding poverty, rapacious and hated. And a prince should guard himself, above all things, against being despised and hated; and liberality leads you to both. Therefore it is wiser to have a reputation for meanness which brings reproach without hatred, than to be compelled through seeking a reputation for liberality to incur a name for rapacity which begets reproach with hatred. And of all princes, it is impossible for the new prince to avoid the imputation of cruelty, owing to new states being full of dangers."
Beowulf: An Anglo-Saxon Epic Poem,J. Lesslie Hall,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16328.html.images,"’Mid the jewels he found then the famous old chieftain, His liegelord belovèd, at his life’s-end gory: He thereupon ’gan to lave him with water, Till the point of his word piercèd his breast-hoard. Beowulf spake (the gold-gems he noticed), The old one in sorrow: “For the jewels I look on Thanks do I utter for all to the Ruler, Wielder of Worship, with words of devotion, The Lord everlasting, that He let me such treasures Gain for my people ere death overtook me. Since I’ve bartered the agèd life to me granted For treasure of jewels, attend ye henceforward"
The Picture of Dorian Gray,Oscar Wilde,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/174/174-h/174-h.htm,"“On the wharf?” “Yes.” “That mad-cat is sure to be there. They won’t have her in this place now.” Dorian shrugged his shoulders. “I am sick of women who love one. Women who hate one are much more interesting. Besides, the stuff is better.” “Much the same.” “I like it better. Come and have something to drink. I must have something.” “I don’t want anything,” murmured the young man. “Never mind.” Adrian Singleton rose up wearily and followed Dorian to the bar. A half-caste, in a ragged turban and a shabby ulster, grinned a hideous greeting as he thrust a bottle of brandy and two tumblers in front of them."
A Tale of Two Cities,Charles Dickens,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/98/98-h/98-h.htm,"In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone to his sumptuous and choice supper. His chair was opposite to the window, and he had taken his soup, and was raising his glass of Bordeaux to his lips, when he put it down. “What is that?” he calmly asked, looking with attention at the horizontal lines of black and stone colour. “Monseigneur? That?” “Outside the blinds. Open the blinds.” It was done. “Well?” “Monseigneur, it is nothing. The trees and the night are all that are here.” The servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out into the vacant darkness, and stood with that blank behind him, looking round for instructions."
The Great Gatsby,F. Scott Fitzgerald,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/64317.html.images,"“How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked helplessly. I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighbourhood. And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer. Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom in college."
The Scarlet Letter,Nathaniel Hawthorne,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25344/25344-h/25344-h.htm,"“It were far worse than death!” replied the minister. “But how to avoid it? What choice remains to me? Shall I lie down again on these withered leaves, where I cast myself when thou didst tell me what he was? Must I sink down there, and die at once?” “Alas, what a ruin has befallen thee!” said Hester, with the tears gushing into her eyes. “Wilt thou die for very weakness? There is no other cause!” “The judgment of God is on me,” answered the conscience-stricken priest. “It is too mighty for me to struggle with!” “Be thou strong for me!” answered he."
Metamorphosis,Franz Kafka,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/5200/5200-h/5200-h.htm,"For the first fourteen days, Gregor’s parents could not bring themselves to come into the room to see him. He would often hear them say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even though, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless and frequently been annoyed with her. But now the two of them, father and mother, would often both wait outside the door of Gregor’s room while his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as she went out again she would have to tell them exactly how everything looked, what Gregor had eaten, how he had behaved this time and whether, perhaps, any slight improvement could be seen."
The Yellow Wallpaper,Charlotte Perkins Gilman,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1952/1952-h/1952-h.htm,"Of course it is only nervousness. It does weigh on me so not to do my duty in any way! I meant to be such a help to John, such a real rest and comfort, and here I am a comparative burden already! Nobody would believe what an effort it is to do what little I am able—to dress and entertain, and order things. It is fortunate Mary is so good with the baby. Such a dear baby! And yet I cannot be with him, it makes me so nervous. I suppose John never was nervous in his life. He laughs at me so about this wallpaper!"
Dracula,Bram Stoker,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/345/345-h/345-h.htm,"Later.—It took all my courage to say good-bye to my darling. We may never meet again. Courage, Mina! the Professor is looking at you keenly; his look is a warning. There must be no tears now—unless it may be that God will let them fall in gladness. Jonathan Harker’s Journal. It is a wild adventure we are on. Here, as we are rushing along through the darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike us; with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes home. We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways; into a whole world of dark and dreadful things."
Grimms' Fairy Tales,Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2591/2591-h/2591-h.htm,"Then the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for his friendly aid, and took the wand and the bread, and went travelling on and on, over sea and over land, till he came to his journey’s end, and found everything to be as the dwarf had told him. The door flew open at the third stroke of the wand, and when the lions were quieted he went on through the castle and came at length to a beautiful hall. Around it he saw several knights sitting in a trance; then he pulled off their rings and put them on his own fingers."
A Doll's House : a play,Henrik Ibsen,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2542/2542-h/2542-h.htm,"But Krogstad did nothing of that sort; he got himself out of it by a cunning trick, and that is why he has gone under altogether. But do you think it would—? How? Because such an atmosphere of lies infects and poisons the whole life of a home. Each breath the children take in such a house is full of the germs of evil. My dear, I have often seen it in the course of my life as a lawyer. Almost everyone who has gone to the bad early in life has had a deceitful mother."
The Iliad,Homer,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/6130/6130-h/6130-h.htm,"Dryden’s Virgil ii. 408. —From mortal mists. “Paradise Lost,” xi. 411. —The race of those. Dryden’s Virgil, vii. 386, sqq.

Jane Eyre: An Autobiography,Charlotte Brontë,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1260/1260-h/1260-h.htm,"“You may look at it,” replied the girl, offering me the book. “Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means? What is Lowood Institution?” “This house where you are come to live.” “And why do they call it Institution? Is it in any way different from other schools?” “Both died before I can remember.” “Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and this is called an institution for educating orphans.” “Do we pay no money? Do they keep us for nothing?” “We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each.”"
"Walden, and On The Duty Of Civil Disobedience",Henry David Thoreau,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/205/205-h/205-h.htm,"A true friend of man; almost the only friend of human progress. An Old Mortality, say rather an Immortality, with unwearied patience and faith making plain the image engraven in men’s bodies, the God of whom they are but defaced and leaning monuments. With his hospitable intellect he embraces children, beggars, insane, and scholars, and entertains the thought of all, adding to it commonly some breadth and elegance. I think that he should keep a caravansary on the world’s highway, where philosophers of all nations might put up, and on his sign should be printed, “Entertainment for man, but not for his beast."
A Modest Proposal,Jonathan Swift,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1080/1080-h/1080-h.htm,"Some persons of a desponding spirit are in great concern about that vast number of poor people, who are aged, diseased, or maimed; and I have been desired to employ my thoughts what course may be taken, to ease the nation of so grievous an incumbrance. But I am not in the least pain upon that matter, because it is very well known, that they are every day dying, and rotting, by cold and famine, and filth, and vermin, as fast as can be reasonably expected. And as to the young labourers, they are now in almost as hopeful a condition."
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,Robert Louis Stevenson,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/43/43-h/43-h.htm,"“By description,” was the reply. “Whose description?” “We have common friends,” said Mr. Utterson. “Common friends,” echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely. “Who are they?” “Jekyll, for instance,” said the lawyer. “He never told you,” cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. “I did not think you would have lied.” “Come,” said Mr. Utterson, “that is not fitting language.” The other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment, with extraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and disappeared into the house. The lawyer stood awhile when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture of disquietude. Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing every step or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mental perplexity."
War and Peace,graf Leo Tolstoy,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2600/2600-h/2600-h.htm,"The right thing now was, if not to retire from the service, at any rate to go home on leave. Why he had to go he did not know; but after his after-dinner nap he gave orders to saddle Mars, an extremely vicious gray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time, and when he returned with the horse all in a lather, he informed Lavrúshka (Denísov’s servant who had remained with him) and his comrades who turned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and was going home. Difficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he would go away without having heard from the staff—and this interested him extremely—whether he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive the Order of St. Anne for the last maneuvers; strange as it was to think that he would go away without having sold his three roans to the Polish Count Golukhovski, who was bargaining for the horses Rostóv had betted he would sell for two thousand rubles; incomprehensible as it seemed that the ball the hussars were giving in honor of the Polish Mademoiselle Przazdziecka (out of rivalry to the Uhlans who had given one in honor of their Polish Mademoiselle Borzozowska) would take place without him—he knew he must go away from this good, bright world to somewhere where everything was stupid and confused."
"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Complete",Mark Twain,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/74/74-h/74-h.htm,"“Well, Tom Sawyer he licked me once.” But that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could say that, and so that cheapened the distinction too much. The group loitered away, still recalling memories of the lost heroes, in awed voices. There was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a moment later the church door creaked; the minister raised his streaming eyes above his handkerchief, and stood transfixed! First one and then another pair of eyes followed the minister’s, and then almost with one impulse the congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up the aisle, Tom in the lead, Joe next, and Huck, a ruin of drooping rags, sneaking sheepishly in the rear! They had been hid in the unused gallery listening to their own funeral sermon!"
Anthem,Ayn Rand,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1250/1250-h/1250-h.htm,"And then we spoke. Our voice was hard and there was no mercy in our voice. We said: “We shall not report our find to the City Council. We shall not report it to any men.” They raised their hands to their ears, for never had they heard such words as these. “International 4-8818,” we asked, “will you report us to the Council and see us lashed to death before your eyes?” They stood straight all of a sudden and they answered: “Rather would we die.” “Then,” we said, “keep silent. This place is ours. This place belongs to us, Equality 7-2521, and to no other men on earth."
A Christmas Carol in Prose; Being a Ghost Story of Christmas,Charles Dickens,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/46/46-h/46-h.htm,"“Are there no prisons?” said the Spirit, turning on him for the last time with his own words. “Are there no workhouses?” The bell struck twelve. Scrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob Marley, and lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and hooded, coming, like a mist along the ground, towards him. The Phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached. When it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery."
The Republic,Plato,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1497.html.images,"What is that? There is a perfection which all knowledge ought to reach, and which our pupils ought also to attain, and not to fall short of, as I was saying that they did in astronomy. For in the science of harmony, as you probably know, the same thing happens. The teachers of harmony compare the sounds and consonances which are heard only, and their labour, like that of the astronomers, is in vain. You mean, I said, those gentlemen who tease and torture the strings and rack them on the pegs of the instrument: I might carry on the metaphor and speak after their manner of the blows which the plectrum gives, and make accusations against the strings, both of backwardness and forwardness to sound; but this would be tedious, and therefore I will only say that these are not the men, and that I am referring to the Pythagoreans, of whom I was just now proposing to enquire about harmony."
Crime and Punishment,Fyodor Dostoyevsky,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2554/2554-h/2554-h.htm,"“Yes... he was so kind... Dounia, I promised Luzhin I’d throw him downstairs and told him to go to hell....” “Rodya, what are you saying! Surely, you don’t mean to tell us...” Pulcheria Alexandrovna began in alarm, but she stopped, looking at Dounia. Avdotya Romanovna was looking attentively at her brother, waiting for what would come next. Both of them had heard of the quarrel from Nastasya, so far as she had succeeded in understanding and reporting it, and were in painful perplexity and suspense. “Dounia,” Raskolnikov continued with an effort, “I don’t want that marriage, so at the first opportunity to-morrow you must refuse Luzhin, so that we may never hear his name again.”"
Heart of Darkness,Joseph Conrad,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/219/219-h/219-h.htm,"“They swore aloud together—out of sheer fright, I believe—then pretending not to know anything of my existence, turned back to the station. The sun was low; and leaning forward side by side, they seemed to be tugging painfully uphill their two ridiculous shadows of unequal length, that trailed behind them slowly over the tall grass without bending a single blade. “Going up that river was like traveling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings. An empty stream, a great silence, an impenetrable forest. The air was warm, thick, heavy, sluggish."
Great Expectations,Charles Dickens,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1400/1400-h/1400-h.htm,"I took what Joe gave me, and found it to be the crumpled play-bill of a small metropolitan theatre, announcing the first appearance, in that very week, of “the celebrated Provincial Amateur of Roscian renown, whose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our National Bard has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic circles.” “Were you at his performance, Joe?” I inquired. “I were,” said Joe, with emphasis and solemnity. “Was there a great sensation?” A ghost-seeing effect in Joe’s own countenance informed me that Herbert had entered the room. So, I presented Joe to Herbert, who held out his hand; but Joe backed from it, and held on by the bird’s-nest."
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,Mark Twain,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/76/76-h/76-h.htm,"Jim’s eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did, too. Then the baldhead says: “No! you can’t mean it?” Well, that was all easy, so we done it. All through dinner Jim stood around and waited on him, and says, “Will yo’ Grace have some o’ dis or some o’ dat?” and so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him. But the old man got pretty silent by and by—didn’t have much to say, and didn’t look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on around that duke. He seemed to have something on his mind."
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,L. Frank Baum,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55/55-h/55-h.htm,"“Or I my courage?” asked the Lion. “Or I my brains?” wailed the Scarecrow, wiping the tears from his eyes with his coat sleeve. “My dear friends,” said Oz, “I pray you not to speak of these little things. Think of me, and the terrible trouble I’m in at being found out.” “Doesn’t anyone else know you’re a humbug?” asked Dorothy. “No one knows it but you four—and myself,” replied Oz. “I have fooled everyone so long that I thought I should never be found out. It was a great mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room. Usually I will not see even my subjects, and so they believe I am something terrible.”"
"The Count of Monte Cristo, Illustrated",Alexandre Dumas,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1184/1184-h/1184-h.htm,"“You?” “Yes.” “You have them?” “I have them.” “Ah, indeed?” said the major, who, seeing the object of his journey frustrated by the absence of the papers, feared also that his forgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the 48,000 francs—“ah, indeed, that is a fortunate circumstance; yes, that really is lucky, for it never occurred to me to bring them.” “I do not at all wonder at it—one cannot think of everything; but, happily, the Abbé Busoni thought for you.” “He is an excellent person.” “He is extremely prudent and thoughtful.” “He is an admirable man,” said the major; “and he sent them to you?”"
Ulysses,James Joyce,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4300/4300-h/4300-h.htm,"Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed. Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there? Must have felt it. See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense of volume. Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark. Wonder would he feel it if something was removed. Feel a gap. Queer idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones. Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn’t that cane? Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest."
The Odyssey,Homer,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1727/1727-h/1727-h.htm,"Meantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over the sea, intent on murdering Telemachus. Now there is a rocky islet called Asteris, of no great size, in mid channel between Ithaca and Samos, and there is a harbour on either side of it where a ship can lie. Here then the Achaeans placed themselves in ambush. A And now, as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus—harbinger of light alike to mortals and immortals—the gods met in council and with them, Jove the lord of thunder, who is their king. Thereon Minerva began to tell them of the many sufferings of Ulysses, for she pitied him away there in the house of the nymph Calypso."
The Prophet,Kahlil Gibran,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/58585/58585-h/58585-h.htm,"But the hunter was also the hunted; For many of my arrows left my bow only to seek my own breast. And the flier was also the creeper; For when my wings were spread in the sun their shadow upon the earth was a turtle. And I the believer was also the doubter; 102For often have I put my finger in my own wound that I might have the greater belief in you and the greater knowledge of you. And it is with this belief and this knowledge that I say, You are not enclosed within your bodies, nor confined to houses or fields."
Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/514/514-h/514-h.htm,"""I know Meg would wet-blanket such a proposal, but I thought you had more spirit,"" began Laurie insinuatingly.

""Yes, but you won't do it,"" answered Laurie, who wished to make up, but felt that his outraged dignity must be appeased first. ""If I can manage the young one, I can the old one,"" muttered Jo, as she walked away, leaving Laurie bent over a railroad map with his head propped up on both hands."
Peter Pan,J. M. Barrie,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16/16-h/16-h.htm,"Up and down they went, and round and round. Heavenly was Wendy’s word. “I say,” cried John, “why shouldn’t we all go out?” Of course it was to this that Peter had been luring them. Michael was ready: he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion miles. But Wendy hesitated. “Mermaids!” said Peter again. “Oo!” “And there are pirates.” “Pirates,” cried John, seizing his Sunday hat, “let us go at once.” It was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana out of 27. They ran into the middle of the street to look up at the nursery window; and, yes, it was still shut, but the room was ablaze with light, and most heart-gripping sight of all, they could see in shadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling round and round, not on the floor but in the air."
Anne of Green Gables,L. M. Montgomery,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/45/45-h/45-h.htm,"“Well, it needn’t prey any longer. I’ll bake you a basket.” “Oh, you dear good Marilla. Oh, you are so kind to me. Oh, I’m so much obliged to you.” Getting through with her “ohs” Anne cast herself into Marilla’s arms and rapturously kissed her sallow cheek. It was the first time in her whole life that childish lips had voluntarily touched Marilla’s face. Again that sudden sensation of startling sweetness thrilled her. She was secretly vastly pleased at Anne’s impulsive caress, which was probably the reason why she said brusquely: “There, there, never mind your kissing nonsense. I’d sooner see you doing strictly as you’re told."
"The Happy Prince, and Other Tales",Oscar Wilde,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/902.html.images,"So they piled the faggots together, and put the Rocket on top, and lit the fire. “This is magnificent,” cried the Rocket, “they are going to let me off in broad day-light, so that every one can see me.” “We will go to sleep now,” they said, “and when we wake up the kettle will be boiled”; and they lay down on the grass, and shut their eyes. The Rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn. At last, however, the fire caught him. “Now I am going off!” he cried, and he made himself very stiff and straight."
The Importance of Being Earnest: A Trivial Comedy for Serious People,Oscar Wilde,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/844/844-h/844-h.htm,"Memory, my dear Cecily, is the diary that we all carry about with us. Yes, but it usually chronicles the things that have never happened, and couldn’t possibly have happened. I believe that Memory is responsible for nearly all the three-volume novels that Mudie sends us. Do not speak slightingly of the three-volume novel, Cecily. I wrote one myself in earlier days. Did you really, Miss Prism? How wonderfully clever you are! I hope it did not end happily? I don’t like novels that end happily. They depress me so much. The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily. That is what Fiction means."

It was out in the country, far from home, far from my foster home, on a dark Sunday night. The road wandered from our rambling log-house up the stony bed of a creek, past wheat and corn, until we could hear dimly across the fields a rhythmic cadence of song,—soft, thrilling, powerful, that swelled and died sorrowfully in our ears."
The American Diary of a Japanese Girl,Yoné Noguchi,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/63256.html.images,"You drop into the toilet room, for instance. You cannot help exclaiming: “Iya, haya, Japan is three centuries behind!” Everything presents to you a silent lecture of scientific modernism. Whenever I am bothered too much by my uncle I lock myself up in the toilet room. There I feel the whole world is mine. I can take off my shoes. I can play acrobat if I prefer. Nobody can spy me.

"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave",Douglass,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/23/23-h/23-h.htm,"I did not, when a slave, understand the deep meaning of those rude and apparently incoherent songs. I was myself within the circle; so that I neither saw nor heard as those without might see and hear. They told a tale of woe which was then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension; they were tones loud, long, and deep; they breathed the prayer and complaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish. Every tone was a testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains. The hearing of those wild notes always depressed my spirit, and filled me with ineffable sadness."

He would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier, and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive.” “You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,” said Stamford with a laugh."

But that night the strangeness of things about me, and my physical wretchedness, prevented me, for I was bruised, weary, wet to the skin, deafened and blinded by the storm. I had a vague idea of going on to my own house, and that was as much motive as I had. I staggered through the trees, fell into a ditch and bruised my knees against a plank, and finally splashed out into the lane that ran down from the College Arms. I say splashed, for the storm water was sweeping the sand down the hill in a muddy torrent."
Don Quixote,Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/996/996-h/996-h.htm,"The canon was astonished at the methodical nonsense (if nonsense be capable of method) that Don Quixote uttered, at the way in which he had described the adventure of the knight of the lake, at the impression that the deliberate lies of the books he read had made upon him, and lastly he marvelled at the simplicity of Sancho, who desired so eagerly to obtain the county his master had promised him. By this time the canon’s servants, who had gone to the inn to fetch the sumpter mule, had returned, and making a carpet and the green grass of the meadow serve as a table, they seated themselves in the shade of some trees and made their repast there, that the carter might not be deprived of the advantage of the spot, as has been already said."

If their intentions are evil they might do you a mischief, and we should be powerless to prevent it.

No, she said, he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire. “So there we go, boys,” said Mr. Dance.

There were two others, who being out of their garrison upon some occasion were set upon; one was knocked on the head, the other escaped; another there was who running along was shot and wounded, and fell down; he begged of them his life, promising them money (as they told me) but they would not hearken to him but knocked him in head, and stripped him naked, and split open his bowels."

She hadn't the least hope in the world. Farmer Brown's boy had only to fire that dreadful gun, and that would be the end of her. She knew it. Poor Old Granny Fox! She had thought that she had been in tight places before, but never, never had she been in such a tight place as this. There stood Farmer Brown's boy looking along the barrel of his dreadful gun straight at her, and only such a short distance, such a very short distance away! It wasn't the least bit of use to run."

I just ask so as to know,"" he muttered in embarrassment. I flushed crimson, as I did so I remembered that I had owed Simonov fifteen roubles for ages--which I had, indeed, never forgotten, though I had not paid it. ""You will understand, Simonov, that I could have no idea when I came here.... I am very much vexed that I have forgotten...."" ""All right, all right, that doesn't matter. You can pay tomorrow after the dinner. I simply wanted to know.... Please don't..."" He broke off and began pacing the room still more vexed."
"Songs of Innocence, and Songs of Experience",William Blake,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1934/1934-h/1934-h.htm,"O what a multitude they seemed, these flowers of London town! Seated in companies they sit, with radiance all their own. The hum of multitudes was there, but multitudes of lambs, Thousands of little boys and girls raising their innocent hands. Now like a mighty wind they raise to heaven the voice of song, Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among: Beneath them sit the aged men, wise guardians of the poor. Then cherish pity, lest you drive an angel from your door. The sun descending in the West, The evening star does shine; The birds are silent in their nest, And I must seek for mine."
An Index of The Divine Comedy,Dante,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8800.html.images,"That sun, which erst with love my bosom warm'd Had of fair truth unveil'd the sweet aspect, By proof of right, and of the false reproof; And I, to own myself convinc'd and free Of doubt, as much as needed, rais'd my head Erect for speech. But soon a sight appear'd, Which, so intent to mark it, held me fix'd, That of confession I no longer thought. As in a quiet and clear lake the fish, If aught approach them from without, do draw Towards it, deeming it their food; so drew Full more than thousand splendours towards us, And in each one was heard: ""Lo! one arriv'd To multiply our loves!"" and as each came The shadow, streaming forth effulgence new, Witness'd augmented joy."
Sense and Sensibility,Jane Austen,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/161/161-h/161-h.htm,"“Oh dear!” cried Margaret, “how happy I should be! I wonder what I should do with it!” Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point. “I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself,” said Mrs. Dashwood, “if my children were all to be rich without my help.” “You must begin your improvements on this house,” observed Elinor, “and your difficulties will soon vanish.” “I love to be reminded of the past, Edward—whether it be melancholy or gay, I love to recall it—and you will never offend me by talking of former times. You are very right in supposing how my money would be spent—some of it, at least—my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books.”"

Common Sense,Thomas Paine,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/147/147-h/147-h.htm,"Alas, we have been long led away by ancient prejudices, and made large sacrifices to superstition. We have boasted the protection of Great-Britain, without considering, that her motive was interest not attachment; that she did not protect us from our enemies on our account, but from her enemies on her own account, from those who had no quarrel with us on any other account, and who will always be our enemies on the same account. Let Britain wave her pretensions to the continent, or the continent throw off the dependance, and we should be at peace with France and Spain were they at war with Britain. The miseries of Hanover last war ought to warn us against connexions."

A breaker of idols, the worshipers whereof are imperfectly gratified by the performance, and most strenuously protest that he unbuildeth but doth not reedify, that he pulleth down but pileth not up. For the poor things would have other idols in place of those he thwacketh upon the mazzard and dispelleth. But the iconoclast saith: ""Ye shall have none at all, for ye need them not; and if the rebuilder fooleth round hereabout, behold I will depress the head of him and sit thereon till he squawk it."""

The Confessions of St. Augustine,Bishop of Hippo Saint Augustine,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3296/3296-h/3296-h.htm,"And yet, Lord, we perceive intervals of times, and compare them, and say, some are shorter, and others longer. We measure also, how much longer or shorter this time is than that; and we answer, ""This is double, or treble; and that, but once, or only just so much as that."" But we measure times as they are passing, by perceiving them; but past, which now are not, or the future, which are not yet, who can measure? unless a man shall presume to say, that can be measured, which is not. When then time is passing, it may be perceived and measured; but when it is past, it cannot, because it is not."

The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more. 5. The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken."

As a rule, avoid making one passive depend directly upon another. In both the examples above, before correction, the word properly related to the second passive is made the subject of the first. A common fault is to use as the subject of a passive construction a noun which expresses the entire action, leaving to the verb no function beyond that of completing the sentence."
