Pride and Prejudice,Jane Austen,"When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him. â€œHe is just what a young man ought to be,â€ said she, â€œsensible, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!â€”so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!â€ â€œHe is also handsome,â€ replied Elizabeth, â€œwhich a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.â€ â€œI was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did not expect such a compliment.â€"
Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,Lewis Carroll,"â€œMine is a long and a sad tale!â€ said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing. â€œIt is a long tail, certainly,â€ said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouseâ€™s tail; â€œbut why do you call it sad?â€ And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:â€” â€œYou are not attending!â€ said the Mouse to Alice severely. â€œWhat are you thinking of?â€ â€œI beg your pardon,â€ said Alice very humbly: â€œyou had got to the fifth bend, I think?â€ â€œI had not!â€ cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily."
"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus",Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley,"When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cherubâ€”a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection."
The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,Arthur Conan Doyle,"â€œIt must be recovered.â€ â€œWe have tried and failed.â€ â€œYour Majesty must pay. It must be bought.â€ â€œShe will not sell.â€ â€œStolen, then.â€ â€œFive attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result.â€ â€œNo sign of it?â€ â€œAbsolutely none.â€ Holmes laughed. â€œIt is quite a pretty little problem,â€ said he. â€œBut a very serious one to me,â€ returned the King reproachfully. â€œVery, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?â€ â€œTo ruin me.â€ â€œBut how?â€ â€œI am about to be married.â€"
"Moby Dick; Or, The Whale",Herman Melville,"The pale Usherâ€”threadbare in coat, heart, body, and brain; I see him now. He was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer handkerchief, mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the known nations of the world. He loved to dust his old grammars; it somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality. â€œWhile you take in hand to school others, and to teach them by what name a whale-fish is to be called in our tongue, leaving out, through ignorance, the letter H, which almost alone maketh up the signification of the word, you deliver that which is not true.â€ â€”Hackluyt."
A Tale of Two Cities,Charles Dickens,"â€œYou know that you are recalled to life?â€ â€œThey tell me so.â€ â€œI hope you care to live?â€ â€œI canâ€™t say.â€ â€œShall I show her to you? Will you come and see her?â€ The answers to this question were various and contradictory. Sometimes the broken reply was, â€œWait! It would kill me if I saw her too soon.â€ Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it was, â€œTake me to her.â€ Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and then it was, â€œI donâ€™t know her. I donâ€™t understand.â€ After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would dig, and dig, digâ€”now with a spade, now with a great key, now with his handsâ€”to dig this wretched creature out."
The Picture of Dorian Gray,Oscar Wilde,"â€œI donâ€™t want you to meet him.â€ â€œYou donâ€™t want me to meet him?â€ â€œNo.â€ â€œMr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir,â€ said the butler, coming into the garden. â€œYou must introduce me now,â€ cried Lord Henry, laughing. The painter turned to his servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight. â€œAsk Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few moments.â€ The man bowed and went up the walk. Then he looked at Lord Henry. â€œDorian Gray is my dearest friend,â€ he said. â€œHe has a simple and a beautiful nature. Your aunt was quite right in what she said of him."
The Prince,NiccolÃ² Machiavelli,"I say, therefore, that in entirely new principalities, where there is a new prince, more or less difficulty is found in keeping them, accordingly as there is more or less ability in him who has acquired the state. Now, as the fact of becoming a prince from a private station presupposes either ability or fortune, it is clear that one or other of these things will mitigate in some degree many difficulties. Nevertheless, he who has relied least on fortune is established the strongest. Further, it facilitates matters when the prince, having no other state, is compelled to reside there in person."
The Great Gatsby,F. Scott Fitzgerald,"â€œTomâ€™s getting very profound,â€ said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. â€œHe reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word weâ€”â€ â€œWell, these books are all scientific,â€ insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently. â€œThis fellow has worked out the whole thing. Itâ€™s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.â€ â€œWeâ€™ve got to beat them down,â€ whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun. â€œYou ought to live in Californiaâ€”â€ began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair."
Metamorphosis,Franz Kafka,"â€œIf he could just understand usâ€, said his father almost as a question; his sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as a sign that of that there was no question. â€œIf he could just understand usâ€, repeated Gregorâ€™s father, closing his eyes in acceptance of his sisterâ€™s certainty that that was quite impossible, â€œthen perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement with him. But as it is ...â€ â€œItâ€™s got to goâ€, shouted his sister, â€œthatâ€™s the only way, Father. Youâ€™ve got to get rid of the idea that thatâ€™s Gregor. Weâ€™ve only harmed ourselves by believing it for so long."
Dracula,Bram Stoker,"Of course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might come into that room when I chose. He answered: â€œYes, certainly,â€ and added:â€” â€œYou may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are locked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand.â€ I said I was sure of this, and then he went on:â€” â€œWe are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things."
Beowulf: An Anglo-Saxon Epic Poem,J. Lesslie Hall,"Grendel.â€”A monster of the race of Cain. Dwells in the fens and moors. Is furiously envious when he hears sounds of joy in Hrothgarâ€™s palace. Causes the king untold agony for years. Is finally conquered by Beowulf, and dies of his wound. His hand and arm are hung up in Hrothgarâ€™s hall Heorot. His head is cut off by Beowulf when he goes down to fight with Grendelâ€™s mother.â€”2 50; 3 1; 3 13; 8 19; 11 17; 12 2; 13 27; 15 3. Guthlaf.â€”A Dane of HnÃ¦fâ€™s party.â€”18 24. Half-Danes.â€”Branch of the Danes to which HnÃ¦f belonged.â€”17 19. Halga.â€”Surnamed the Good. Younger brother of Hrothgar.â€”2 9."
Grimms' Fairy Tales,Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm,"Then the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could discover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses danced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his wife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not succeed, after three days and nights, should be put to death. A kingâ€™s son soon came. He was well entertained, and in the evening was taken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their twelve beds. There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance; and, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door of his chamber was left open."
The Yellow Wallpaper,Charlotte Perkins Gilman,"Thereâ€™s sister on the stairs! Well, the Fourth of July is over! The people are gone and I am tired out. John thought it might do me good to see a little company, so we just had mother and Nellie and the children down for a week. Of course I didnâ€™t do a thing. Jennie sees to everything now. But it tired me all the same. John says if I donâ€™t pick up faster he shall send me to Weir Mitchell in the fall. But I donâ€™t want to go there at all. I had a friend who was in his hands once, and she says he is just like John and my brother, only more so!"
Jane Eyre: An Autobiography,Charlotte BrontÃ«,"â€œYou ought to be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go to the poorhouse.â€ I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind. This reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very painful and crushing, but only half intelligible. Miss Abbot joined inâ€” â€œAnd you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with them."
The Scarlet Letter,Nathaniel Hawthorne,"The door of the jail being flung open from within, there appeared, in the first place, like a black shadow emerging into sunshine, the grim and grisly presence of the town-beadle, with a sword by his side, and his staff of office in his hand. This personage prefigured and represented in his aspect the whole dismal severity of the Puritanic code of law, which it was his business to administer in its final and closest application to the offender. Stretching forth the official staff in his left hand, he laid his right upon the shoulder of a young woman, whom he thus drew forward; until, on the threshold of the prison-door, she repelled him, by an action marked with natural dignity and force of character, and stepped into the open air, as if by her own free will."
The Iliad,Homer,"This strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful star, which, in the violence of its course, drew all things within its vortex. It seemed not enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts, and the whole compass of nature, to supply his maxims and reflections; all the inward passions and affections of mankind, to furnish his characters: and all the outward forms and images of things for his descriptions: but wanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in, he opened a new and boundless walk for his imagination, and created a world for himself in the invention of fable."
A Doll's House : a play,Henrik Ibsen,"HELMER. If it is a caller, remember I am not at home. NORA. Ask her to come in. HELMER. Did he go straight into my room? MAID. Yes, sir. MRS LINDE. You donâ€™t recognise me, I suppose. MRS LINDE. Yes, it is I. MRS LINDE. Yes, I have indeed. In nine, ten long yearsâ€” NORA. Is it so long since we met? I suppose it is. The last eight years have been a happy time for me, I can tell you. And so now you have come into the town, and have taken this long journey in winterâ€”that was plucky of you."
"Walden, and On The Duty Of Civil Disobedience",Henry David Thoreau,"Such is the universal law, which no man can ever outwit, and with regard to the railroad even we may say it is as broad as it is long. To make a railroad round the world available to all mankind is equivalent to grading the whole surface of the planet. Men have an indistinct notion that if they keep up this activity of joint stocks and spades long enough all will at length ride somewhere, in next to no time, and for nothing; but though a crowd rushes to the depot, and the conductor shouts â€œAll aboard!â€ when the smoke is blown away and the vapor condensed, it will be perceived that a few are riding, but the rest are run over,â€”and it will be called, and will be, â€œA melancholy accident.â€ No doubt they can ride at last who shall have earned their fare, that is, if they survive so long, but they will probably have lost their elasticity and desire to travel by that time."
War and Peace,graf Leo Tolstoy,"The vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then current, to the effect that the Duc dâ€™Enghien had gone secretly to Paris to visit Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon Bonaparte, who also enjoyed the famous actressâ€™ favors, and that in his presence Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject, and was thus at the ducâ€™s mercy. The latter spared him, and this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death. The story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point where the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies looked agitated."
"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Complete",Mark Twain,"â€œCanâ€™t!â€ An uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said: â€œWhatâ€™s your name?â€ â€œâ€™Tisnâ€™t any of your business, maybe.â€ â€œWell I â€™low Iâ€™ll make it my business.â€ â€œWell why donâ€™t you?â€ â€œIf you say much, I will.â€ â€œMuchâ€”muchâ€”much. There now.â€ â€œOh, you think youâ€™re mighty smart, donâ€™t you? I could lick you with one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.â€ â€œWell why donâ€™t you do it? You say you can do it.â€ â€œWell I will, if you fool with me.â€ â€œOh yesâ€”Iâ€™ve seen whole families in the same fix.â€ â€œSmarty! You think youâ€™re some, now, donâ€™t you? Oh, what a hat!â€"
Crime and Punishment,Fyodor Dostoyevsky,"â€œSo the sun will shine like this then too!â€ flashed as it were by chance through Raskolnikovâ€™s mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned everything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and remember its arrangement. But there was nothing special in the room. The furniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with a huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a dressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows, chairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow frames, representing German damsels with birds in their handsâ€”that was all."
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,Robert Louis Stevenson,"â€œYou know I never approved of it,â€ pursued Utterson, ruthlessly disregarding the fresh topic. â€œMy will? Yes, certainly, I know that,â€ said the doctor, a trifle sharply. â€œYou have told me so.â€ â€œWell, I tell you so again,â€ continued the lawyer. â€œI have been learning something of young Hyde.â€ The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and there came a blackness about his eyes. â€œI do not care to hear more,â€ said he. â€œThis is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.â€ â€œWhat I heard was abominable,â€ said Utterson. â€œIt can make no change."
Great Expectations,Charles Dickens,"â€œYou know, old chap,â€ said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs. Joe, with his bite still in his cheek, â€œI Bolted, myself, when I was your ageâ€”frequentâ€”and as a boy Iâ€™ve been among a many Bolters; but I never see your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and itâ€™s a mercy you ainâ€™t Bolted dead.â€ My sister made a dive at me, and fished me up by the hair, saying nothing more than the awful words, â€œYou come along and be dosed.â€ It was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, with a copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock."
Ulysses,James Joyce,"Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said: â€”What? Where? I canâ€™t remember anything. I remember only ideas and sensations. Why? What happened in the name of God? â€”You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get more hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom. She asked you who was in your room. â€”Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget. â€”You said, Stephen answered, O, itâ€™s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly dead. A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulliganâ€™s cheek. â€”Did I say that? he asked."
"The Count of Monte Cristo, Illustrated",Alexandre Dumas,"â€œRight, DantÃ¨s, quite right. I always knew you were a good son.â€ â€œAnd,â€ inquired DantÃ¨s, with some hesitation, â€œdo you know how my father is?â€ â€œWell, I believe, my dear Edmond, though I have not seen him lately.â€ â€œYes, he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room.â€ â€œThat proves, at least, that he has wanted for nothing during your absence.â€ DantÃ¨s smiled. â€œMy father is proud, sir, and if he had not a meal left, I doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone, except from Heaven.â€ â€œWell, then, after this first visit has been made we shall count on you.â€"
A Christmas Carol in Prose; Being a Ghost Story of Christmas,Charles Dickens,"At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out, and put on his hat. â€œYouâ€™ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?â€ said Scrooge. â€œIf quite convenient, sir.â€ â€œItâ€™s not convenient,â€ said Scrooge, â€œand itâ€™s not fair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, youâ€™d think yourself ill-used, Iâ€™ll be bound?â€ The clerk smiled faintly. â€œAnd yet,â€ said Scrooge, â€œyou donâ€™t think me ill-used, when I pay a dayâ€™s wages for no work.â€"
Heart of Darkness,Joseph Conrad,"â€œThe earth seemed unearthly. We are accustomed to look upon the shackled form of a conquered monster, but thereâ€”there you could look at a thing monstrous and free. It was unearthly, and the men wereâ€”No, they were not inhuman. Well, you know, that was the worst of itâ€”this suspicion of their not being inhuman. It would come slowly to one. They howled and leaped, and spun, and made horrid faces; but what thrilled you was just the thought of their humanityâ€”like yoursâ€”the thought of your remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar. Ugly. Yes, it was ugly enough; but if you were man enough you would admit to yourself that there was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the terrible frankness of that noise, a dim suspicion of there being a meaning in it which youâ€”you so remote from the night of first agesâ€”could comprehend."
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,L. Frank Baum,"The three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey, after which they walked away through the trees. The Witch gave Dorothy a friendly little nod, whirled around on her left heel three times, and straightway disappeared, much to the surprise of little Toto, who barked after her loudly enough when she had gone, because he had been afraid even to growl while she stood by. But Dorothy, knowing her to be a witch, had expected her to disappear in just that way, and was not surprised in the least. When Dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry."
The Republic,Plato,"And the second principle is like unto it:â€”With God is no variableness or change of form. Reason teaches us this; for if we suppose a change in God, he must be changed either by another or by himself. By another?â€”but the best works of nature and art and the noblest qualities of mind are least liable to be changed by any external force. By himself?â€”but he cannot change for the better; he will hardly change for the worse. He remains for ever fairest and best in his own image. Therefore we refuse to listen to the poets who tell us of Here begging in the likeness of a priestess or of other deities who prowl about at night in strange disguises; all that blasphemous nonsense with which mothers fool the manhood out of their children must be suppressed."
The Prophet,Kahlil Gibran,"Prophet of God, in quest of the uttermost, long have you searched the distances for your ship. And now your ship has come, and you must needs go. Deep is your longing for the land of your memories and the dwelling place of your greater desires; and our love would not bind you nor our needs hold you. Yet this we ask ere you leave us, that you speak to us and give us of your truth. And we will give it unto our children, and they unto their children, and it shall not perish. In your aloneness you have watched with our days, and in your wakefulness you have listened to the weeping and the laughter of our sleep."
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,Mark Twain,"â€œWell, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldnâ€™t let on. Kill the women? No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that. You fetch them to the cave, and youâ€™re always as polite as pie to them; and by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home any more.â€ â€œWell, if thatâ€™s the way Iâ€™m agreed, but I donâ€™t take no stock in it. Mighty soon weâ€™ll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows waiting to be ransomed, that there wonâ€™t be no place for the robbers."
A Modest Proposal,Jonathan Swift,"Fifthly, This food would likewise bring great custom to taverns, where the vintners will certainly be so prudent as to procure the best receipts for dressing it to perfection; and consequently have their houses frequented by all the fine gentlemen, who justly value themselves upon their knowledge in good eating; and a skilful cook, who understands how to oblige his guests, will contrive to make it as expensive as they please. Sixthly, This would be a great inducement to marriage, which all wise nations have either encouraged by rewards, or enforced by laws and penalties. It would encrease the care and tenderness of mothers towards their children, when they were sure of a settlement for life to the poor babes, provided in some sort by the publick, to their annual profit instead of expence."
Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,"""I don't remember much about it, except that I was afraid of the cellar and the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the top. If I wasn't too old for such things, I'd rather like to play it over again,"" said Amy, who began to talk of renouncing childish things at the mature age of twelve. ""We never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play we are playing all the time in one way or another. Our burdens are here, our road is before us, and the longing for goodness and happiness is the guide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace which is a true Celestial City. Now, my little pilgrims, suppose you begin again, not in play, but in earnest, and see how far on you can get before Father comes home."""
Peter Pan,J. M. Barrie,"â€œBoy.â€ Then he had leapt into her arms. Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana to recall now, but not so little if that was to be Michaelâ€™s last night in the nursery. They go on with their recollections. â€œIt was then that I rushed in like a tornado, wasnâ€™t it?â€ Mr. Darling would say, scorning himself; and indeed he had been like a tornado. Perhaps there was some excuse for him. He, too, had been dressing for the party, and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie. It is an astounding thing to have to tell, but this man, though he knew about stocks and shares, had no real mastery of his tie."
The American Diary of a Japanese Girl,YonÃ© Noguchi,"When he shall come to understand what is Love! Fie on him! I never felt more insulted than when I was asked in marriage by one unknown to me. No Oriental man is qualified for civilisation, I declare. Educate man, butâ€”beg your pardonâ€”not the woman! Modern gyurls born in the enlightened period of Meiji are endowed with quite a remarkable soul. I act as I choose. I havenâ€™t to wait for my mammaâ€™s approval to laugh when I incline to. Oct. 1stâ€”I stole into the looking-glassâ€”woman loses almost her delight in life if without itâ€”for the last glimpse of my hair in Japan style."
Anne of Green Gables,L. M. Montgomery,"MATTHEW Cuthbert and the sorrel mare jogged comfortably over the eight miles to Bright River. It was a pretty road, running along between snug farmsteads, with now and again a bit of balsamy fir wood to drive through or a hollow where wild plums hung out their filmy bloom. The air was sweet with the breath of many apple orchards and the meadows sloped away in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple; while Matthew enjoyed the drive after his own fashion, except during the moments when he met women and had to nod to themâ€”for in Prince Edward island you are supposed to nod to all and sundry you meet on the road whether you know them or not."
Anthem,Ayn Rand,"The other women were far off in the field, when we stopped at the hedge by the side of the road. The Golden One were kneeling alone at the moat which runs through the field. And the drops of water falling from their hands, as they raised the water to their lips, were like sparks of fire in the sun. Then the Golden One saw us, and they did not move, kneeling there, looking at us, and circles of light played upon their white tunic, from the sun on the water of the moat, and one sparkling drop fell from a finger of their hand held as frozen in the air."
The Importance of Being Earnest: A Trivial Comedy for Serious People,Oscar Wilde,"ALGERNON. Yes. But why does your aunt call you her uncle? â€˜From little Cecily, with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.â€™ There is no objection, I admit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no matter what her size may be, should call her own nephew her uncle, I canâ€™t quite make out. Besides, your name isnâ€™t Jack at all; it is Ernest. JACK. It isnâ€™t Ernest; itâ€™s Jack. JACK. Well, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the cigarette case was given to me in the country. ALGERNON. Yes, but that does not account for the fact that your small Aunt Cecily, who lives at Tunbridge Wells, calls you her dear uncle."
A Study in Scarlet,Arthur Conan Doyle,"His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination. â€œYou are to be congratulated,â€ I remarked, considerably surprised at his enthusiasm. â€œThere was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier, and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive.â€ â€œYou seem to be a walking calendar of crime,â€ said Stamford with a laugh."
Don Quixote,Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra,"The true nature of the â€œright armâ€ and the â€œbright array,â€ before which, according to the poet, â€œthe world gave ground,â€ and which Cervantesâ€™ single laugh demolished, may be gathered from the words of one of his own countrymen, Don Felix Pacheco, as reported by Captain George Carleton, in his â€œMilitary Memoirs from 1672 to 1713.â€ â€œBefore the appearance in the world of that labour of Cervantes,â€ he said, â€œit was next to an impossibility for a man to walk the streets with any delight or without danger. There were seen so many cavaliers prancing and curvetting before the windows of their mistresses, that a stranger would have imagined the whole nation to have been nothing less than a race of knight-errants."
"The Happy Prince, and Other Tales",Oscar Wilde,"â€œAlas! I have no ruby now,â€ said the Prince; â€œmy eyes are all that I have left. They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of India a thousand years ago. Pluck out one of them and take it to him. He will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish his play.â€ â€œDear Prince,â€ said the Swallow, â€œI cannot do thatâ€; and he began to weep. â€œSwallow, Swallow, little Swallow,â€ said the Prince, â€œdo as I command you.â€ So the Swallow plucked out the Princeâ€™s eye, and flew away to the studentâ€™s garret. It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in the roof."
The Odyssey,Homer,"â€œHear me,â€ he cried, â€œyou god who visited me yesterday, and bade me sail the seas in search of my father who has so long been missing. I would obey you, but the Achaeans, and more particularly the wicked suitors, are hindering me that I cannot do so.â€ As he thus prayed, Minerva came close up to him in the likeness and with the voice of Mentor. â€œTelemachus,â€ said she, â€œif you are made of the same stuff as your father you will be neither fool nor coward henceforward, for Ulysses never broke his word nor left his work half done."
The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana,Vatsyayana,"Objection 1. Some learned men say that as Dharma is connected with things not belonging to this world, it is appropriately treated of in a book; and so also is Artha, because it is practised only by the application of proper means, and a knowledge of those means can only be obtained by study and from books. But Kama being a thing which is practised even by the brute creation, and which is to be found everywhere, does not want any work on the subject. Answer. This is not so. Sexual intercourse being a thing dependent on man and woman requires the application of proper means by them, and those means are to be learnt from the Kama Shastra. The non-application of proper means, which we see in the brute creation, is caused by their being unrestrained, and by the females among them only being fit for sexual intercourse at certain seasons and no more, and by their intercourse not being preceded by thought of any kind."
The Romance of Lust: A classic Victorian erotic novel,Anonymous,"I knelt close to the footstool on which her foot rested; it was raised up, and a very slight movement brought it against my person, at first rather below where my throbbing prick was distending my trousers. As she commenced to wind her ball, she gradually pushed her foot further forward, until the toe actually touched the knob of my cock, and occasionally moved it right and left, exciting me beyond measure. I flushed up to the very ears, and trembled so violently that I thought I should have dropped the skein. â€œMy dear boy, what is the matter with you, that you blush and tremble so, are you unwell?â€"
The War of the Worlds,H. G. Wells,"â€œWhat ugly brutes!â€ he said. â€œGood God! What ugly brutes!â€ He repeated this over and over again. â€œDid you see a man in the pit?â€ I said; but he made no answer to that. We became silent, and stood watching for a time side by side, deriving, I fancy, a certain comfort in one anotherâ€™s company. Then I shifted my position to a little knoll that gave me the advantage of a yard or more of elevation and when I looked for him presently he was walking towards Woking. The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened. The crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard now a faint murmur from it."
The Souls of Black Folk,W. E. B. Du Bois,"Mr. Washington represents in Negro thought the old attitude of adjustment and submission; but adjustment at such a peculiar time as to make his programme unique. This is an age of unusual economic development, and Mr. Washingtonâ€™s programme naturally takes an economic cast, becoming a gospel of Work and Money to such an extent as apparently almost completely to overshadow the higher aims of life. Moreover, this is an age when the more advanced races are coming in closer contact with the less developed races, and the race-feeling is therefore intensified; and Mr. Washingtonâ€™s programme practically accepts the alleged inferiority of the Negro races."
Around the World in Eighty Days,Jules Verne,"â€œItâ€™s absurd!â€ cried Stuart, who was beginning to be annoyed at the persistency of his friend. â€œCome, letâ€™s go on with the game.â€ â€œDeal over again, then,â€ said Phileas Fogg. â€œThereâ€™s a false deal.â€ Stuart took up the pack with a feverish hand; then suddenly put them down again. â€œWell, Mr. Fogg,â€ said he, â€œit shall be so: I will wager the four thousand on it.â€ â€œCalm yourself, my dear Stuart,â€ said Fallentin. â€œItâ€™s only a joke.â€ â€œWhen I say Iâ€™ll wager,â€ returned Stuart, â€œI mean it.â€ â€œAll right,â€ said Mr. Fogg; and, turning to the others, he continued: â€œI have a deposit of twenty thousand at Baringâ€™s which I will willingly risk upon it.â€"
Treasure Island,Robert Louis Stevenson,"Between us, with much trouble, we managed to hoist him upstairs, and laid him on his bed, where his head fell back on the pillow as if he were almost fainting. â€œNow, mind you,â€ said the doctor, â€œI clear my conscienceâ€”the name of rum for you is death.â€ And with that he went off to see my father, taking me with him by the arm. â€œThis is nothing,â€ he said as soon as he had closed the door. â€œI have drawn blood enough to keep him quiet awhile; he should lie for a week where he isâ€”that is the best thing for him and you; but another stroke would settle him.â€"
"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave",Douglass,"I had resided but a short time in Baltimore before I observed a marked difference, in the treatment of slaves, from that which I had witnessed in the country. A city slave is almost a freeman, compared with a slave on the plantation. He is much better fed and clothed, and enjoys privileges altogether unknown to the slave on the plantation. There is a vestige of decency, a sense of shame, that does much to curb and check those outbreaks of atrocious cruelty so commonly enacted upon the plantation. He is a desperate slaveholder, who will shock the humanity of his non-slaveholding neighbors with the cries of his lacerated slave."
The Hound of the Baskervilles,Arthur Conan Doyle,"â€œWell?â€ said he. â€œDo you not find it interesting?â€ â€œTo a collector of fairy tales.â€ Dr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket. â€œNow, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more recent. This is the Devon County Chronicle of May 14th of this year. It is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of Sir Charles Baskerville which occurred a few days before that date.â€ My friend leaned a little forward and his expression became intent. Our visitor readjusted his glasses and began: â€œThe recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose name has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate for Mid-Devon at the next election, has cast a gloom over the county."
Wuthering Heights,Emily BrontÃ«,"The business of eating being concluded, and no one uttering a word of sociable conversation, I approached a window to examine the weather. A sorrowful sight I saw: dark night coming down prematurely, and sky and hills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow. â€œI donâ€™t think it possible for me to get home now without a guide,â€ I could not help exclaiming. â€œThe roads will be buried already; and, if they were bare, I could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance.â€ â€œHareton, drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch. Theyâ€™ll be covered if left in the fold all night: and put a plank before them,â€ said Heathcliff."
Emma,Jane Austen,"With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number and meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin, and there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured and obliging. He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was of them, and in every thing else he was so very obliging. He had his shepherdâ€™s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her."
"The Extraordinary Adventures of Arsene Lupin, Gentleman-Burglar",Maurice Leblanc,"Thus it appeared that Rozaine was not ArsÃ¨ne Lupin; but was Rozaine, the son of a Bordeaux merchant. And the presence of ArsÃ¨ne Lupin was once more affirmed, and that in a most alarming manner. Such was the state of terror amongst the passengers that none would remain alone in a stateroom or wander singly in unfrequented parts of the vessel. We clung together as a matter of safety. And yet the most intimate acquaintances were estranged by a mutual feeling of distrust. ArsÃ¨ne Lupin was, now, anybody and everybody. Our excited imaginations attributed to him miraculous and unlimited power. We supposed him capable of assuming the most unexpected disguises; of being, by turns, the highly respectable Major Rawson or the noble Marquis de Raverdan, or evenâ€”for we no longer stopped with the accusing letter of Râ€”or even such or such a person well known to all of us, and having wife, children and servants."
Les MisÃ©rables,Victor Hugo,"Being, as he described himself with a smile, an ex-sinner, he had none of the asperities of austerity, and he professed, with a good deal of distinctness, and without the frown of the ferociously virtuous, a doctrine which may be summed up as follows:â€” â€œMan has upon him his flesh, which is at once his burden and his temptation. He drags it with him and yields to it. He must watch it, check it, repress it, and obey it only at the last extremity. There may be some fault even in this obedience; but the fault thus committed is venial; it is a fall, but a fall on the knees which may terminate in prayer."
"The Awakening, and Selected Short Stories",Kate Chopin,"She stood watching the fair woman walk down the long line of galleries with the grace and majesty which queens are sometimes supposed to possess. Her little ones ran to meet her. Two of them clung about her white skirts, the third she took from its nurse and with a thousand endearments bore it along in her own fond, encircling arms. Though, as everybody well knew, the doctor had forbidden her to lift so much as a pin! â€œAre you going bathing?â€ asked Robert of Mrs. Pontellier. It was not so much a question as a reminder. â€œOh, no,â€ she answered, with a tone of indecision."
The Brothers Karamazov,Fyodor Dostoyevsky,"â€œAh, I dare say you are a connoisseur in that. But, look here, Fyodor Pavlovitch, you said just now that we had given our word to behave properly. Remember it. I advise you to control yourself. But, if you begin to play the fool I donâ€™t intend to be associated with you here.... You see what a man he isâ€â€”he turned to the monkâ€”â€œIâ€™m afraid to go among decent people with him.â€ A fine smile, not without a certain slyness, came on to the pale, bloodless lips of the monk, but he made no reply, and was evidently silent from a sense of his own dignity."
Uncle Tom's Cabin,Harriet Beecher Stowe,"Eliza had been brought up by her mistress, from girlhood, as a petted and indulged favorite. The traveller in the south must often have remarked that peculiar air of refinement, that softness of voice and manner, which seems in many cases to be a particular gift to the quadroon and mulatto women. These natural graces in the quadroon are often united with beauty of the most dazzling kind, and in almost every case with a personal appearance prepossessing and agreeable. Eliza, such as we have described her, is not a fancy sketch, but taken from remembrance, as we saw her, years ago, in Kentucky. Safe under the protecting care of her mistress, Eliza had reached maturity without those temptations which make beauty so fatal an inheritance to a slave."
The Time Machine,H. G. Wells,"â€œYouâ€™ve just come? Itâ€™s rather odd. Heâ€™s unavoidably detained. He asks me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if heâ€™s not back. Says heâ€™ll explain when he comes.â€ He was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and smeared with green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it seemed to me greyerâ€”either with dust and dirt or because its colour had actually faded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown cut on itâ€”a cut half-healed; his expression was haggard and drawn, as by intense suffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway, as if he had been dazzled by the light."
Dubliners,James Joyce,"â€œWhat is this rubbish?â€ he said. â€œThe Apache Chief! Is this what you read instead of studying your Roman History? Let me not find any more of this wretched stuff in this college. The man who wrote it, I suppose, was some wretched fellow who writes these things for a drink. Iâ€™m surprised at boys like you, educated, reading such stuff. I could understand it if you were ... National School boys. Now, Dillon, I advise you strongly, get at your work or....â€ This rebuke during the sober hours of school paled much of the glory of the Wild West for me and the confused puffy face of Leo Dillon awakened one of my consciences."

The Jungle Book,Rudyard Kipling,"There was a clamor of scores of voices, saying: â€œWhat matter? He will die in the winter rains. He will scorch in the sun. What harm can a naked frog do us? Let him run with the Pack. Where is the bull, Bagheera? Let him be accepted.â€ And then came Akelaâ€™s deep bay, crying: â€œLook wellâ€”look well, O Wolves!â€ Mowgli was still deeply interested in the pebbles, and he did not notice when the wolves came and looked at him one by one. At last they all went down the hill for the dead bull, and only Akela, Bagheera, Baloo, and Mowgliâ€™s own wolves were left."
The Call of the Wild,Jack London,"An oath from Perrault, the resounding impact of a club upon a bony frame, and a shrill yelp of pain, heralded the breaking forth of pandemonium. The camp was suddenly discovered to be alive with skulking furry forms,â€”starving huskies, four or five score of them, who had scented the camp from some Indian village. They had crept in while Buck and Spitz were fighting, and when the two men sprang among them with stout clubs they showed their teeth and fought back. They were crazed by the smell of the food. Perrault found one with head buried in the grub-box. His club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs, and the grub-box was capsized on the ground."
The Secret Garden,Frances Hodgson Burnett,"â€œOh! did she die!â€ she exclaimed, quite without meaning to. She had just remembered a French fairy story she had once read called â€œRiquet Ã  la Houppe.â€ It had been about a poor hunchback and a beautiful princess and it had made her suddenly sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven. â€œYes, she died,â€ Mrs. Medlock answered. â€œAnd it made him queerer than ever. He cares about nobody. He wonâ€™t see people. Most of the time he goes away, and when he is at Misselthwaite he shuts himself up in the West Wing and wonâ€™t let anyone but Pitcher see him. Pitcherâ€™s an old fellow, but he took care of him when he was a child and he knows his ways.â€"
The Mysterious Affair at Styles,Agatha Christie,"Cynthia Murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature, full of life and vigour. She tossed off her little V.A.D. cap, and I admired the great loose waves of her auburn hair, and the smallness and whiteness of the hand she held out to claim her tea. With dark eyes and eyelashes she would have been a beauty. She flung herself down on the ground beside John, and as I handed her a plate of sandwiches she smiled up at me. â€œSit down here on the grass, do. Itâ€™s ever so much nicer.â€ I dropped down obediently. â€œYou work at Tadminster, donâ€™t you, Miss Murdoch?â€"
Beyond Good and Evil,Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"63. He who is a thorough teacher takes things seriouslyâ€”and even himselfâ€”only in relation to his pupils. 64. ""Knowledge for its own sake""â€”that is the last snare laid by morality: we are thereby completely entangled in morals once more. 65. The charm of knowledge would be small, were it not so much shame has to be overcome on the way to it. 65A. We are most dishonourable towards our God: he is not PERMITTED to sin. 66. The tendency of a person to allow himself to be degraded, robbed, deceived, and exploited might be the diffidence of a God among men."
The King James Version of the Bible,,"4:21 And his brotherâ€™s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ. 4:22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah. 4:23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt. 4:24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold. 4:25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew."
David Copperfield,Charles Dickens,"Instead of looking back, therefore, I will look forward. I cannot close this Volume more agreeably to myself, than with a hopeful glance towards the time when I shall again put forth my two green leaves once a month, and with a faithful remembrance of the genial sun and showers that have fallen on these leaves of David Copperfield, and made me happy. I REMARKED in the original Preface to this Book, that I did not find it easy to get sufficiently far away from it, in the first sensations of having finished it, to refer to it with the composure which this formal heading would seem to require."
Simple Sabotage Field Manual,United States. Office of Strategic Services,"(3) Using a very rapid stroke will wear out a file before its time. So will dragging a file in slow strokes under heavy pressure. Exert pressure on the backward stroke as well as the forward stroke. (4) Clean files by knocking them against the vise or the workpiece; they are easily broken this way. (5) Bits and drills will snap under heavy pressure. (6) You can put a press punch out of order by putting in it more material than it is adjusted forâ€”two blanks instead of one, for example. (7) Power-driven tools like pneumatic drills, riveters, and so on, are never efficient when dirty."
Leviathan,Thomas Hobbes,"Out of all which we may define, (that is to say determine,) what that is, which is meant by this word Reason, when wee reckon it amongst the Faculties of the mind. For Reason, in this sense, is nothing but Reckoning (that is, Adding and Substracting) of the Consequences of generall names agreed upon, for the Marking and Signifying of our thoughts; I say Marking them, when we reckon by our selves; and Signifying, when we demonstrate, or approve our reckonings to other men. And as in Arithmetique, unpractised men must, and Professors themselves may often erre, and cast up false; so also in any other subject of Reasoning, the ablest, most attentive, and most practised men, may deceive themselves, and inferre false Conclusions; Not but that Reason it selfe is always Right Reason, as well as Arithmetique is a certain and infallible art: But no one mans Reason, nor the Reason of any one number of men, makes the certaintie; no more than an account is therefore well cast up, because a great many men have unanimously approved it."
Anna Karenina,graf Leo Tolstoy,"Seeing her husband, she dropped her hands into the drawer of the bureau as though looking for something, and only looked round at him when he had come quite up to her. But her face, to which she tried to give a severe and resolute expression, betrayed bewilderment and suffering. â€œWhat do you want?â€ she said in a rapid, deep, unnatural voice. â€œDolly!â€ he repeated, with a quiver in his voice. â€œAnna is coming today.â€ â€œWell, what is that to me? I canâ€™t see her!â€ she cried. â€œBut you must, really, Dolly....â€ â€œGo away, go away, go away!â€ she shrieked, not looking at him, as though this shriek were called up by physical pain."
Meditations,Emperor of Rome Marcus Aurelius,"Whilst I was at Carnuntum. I. A man must not only consider how daily his life wasteth and decreaseth, but this also, that if he live long, he cannot be certain, whether his understanding shall continue so able and sufficient, for either discreet consideration, in matter of businesses; or for contemplation: it being the thing, whereon true knowledge of things both divine and human, doth depend. For if once he shall begin to dote, his respiration, nutrition, his imaginative, and appetitive, and other natural faculties, may still continue the same: he shall find no want of them. But how to make that right use of himself that he should, how to observe exactly in all things that which is right and just, how to redress and rectify all wrong, or sudden apprehensions and imaginations, and even of this particular, whether he should live any longer or no, to consider duly; for all such things, wherein the best strength and vigour of the mind is most requisite; his power and ability will be past and gone."
"The Slang Dictionary: Etymological, Historical and Andecdotal",John Camden Hotten,"Freshe water mariners, these kind of caterpillers counterfet great losses on the sea:â€”their shippes were drowned in the playne of Salisbury. Fylche, to robbe: Fylch-man, a robber. Gage, a quart pot. Gan, a mouth. Gentry cofe, a noble or gentle man. Gentry cofes ken, a noble or gentle manâ€™s house. Gentry mort, a noble or gentle woman.

Gulliver's Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World,Jonathan Swift,"It was now day-light, and I returned to my house without waiting to congratulate with the emperor: because, although I had done a very eminent piece of service, yet I could not tell how his majesty might resent the manner by which I had performed it: for, by the fundamental laws of the realm, it is capital in any person, of what quality soever, to make water within the precincts of the palace. But I was a little comforted by a message from his majesty, â€œthat he would give orders to the grand justiciary for passing my pardon in form:â€ which, however, I could not obtain; and I was privately assured, â€œthat the empress, conceiving the greatest abhorrence of what I had done, removed to the most distant side of the court, firmly resolved that those buildings should never be repaired for her use: and, in the presence of her chief confidents could not forbear vowing revenge.â€"
Calculus Made Easy,Silvanus P. Thompson,
The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,Washington Irving,"â€œThat, therefore, he that runs races with goblin troopers is likely to have rough riding of it. â€œErgo, for a country schoolmaster to be refused the hand of a Dutch heiress is a certain step to high preferment in the state.â€ The cautious old gentleman knit his brows tenfold closer after this explanation, being sorely puzzled by the ratiocination of the syllogism, while, methought, the one in pepper-and-salt eyed him with something of a triumphant leer. At length he observed that all this was very well, but still he thought the story a little on the extravagant--there were one or two points on which he had his doubts."
Second Treatise of Government,John Locke,"Sect. 58. The power, then, that parents have over their children, arises from that duty which is incumbent on them, to take care of their off-spring, during the imperfect state of childhood. To inform the mind, and govern the actions of their yet ignorant nonage, till reason shall take its place, and ease them of that trouble, is what the children want, and the parents are bound to: for God having given man an understanding to direct his actions, has allowed him a freedom of will, and liberty of acting, as properly belonging thereunto, within the bounds of that law he is under."
Thus Spake Zarathustra: A Book for All and None,Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"All-too-similar are they still to each other. Verily even the greatest found Iâ€”all-too-human!â€â€” This type must not be regarded as a fanciful figure: it is not a nebulous hope which is to be realised at some indefinitely remote period, thousands of years hence; nor is it a new species (in the Darwinian sense) of which we can know nothing, and which it would therefore be somewhat absurd to strive after. But it is meant to be a possibility which men of the present could realise with all their spiritual and physical energies, provided they adopted the new values. â€œThe fundamental idea of my workâ€”namely, the Eternal Recurrence of all thingsâ€”this highest of all possible formulae of a Yea-saying philosophy, first occurred to me in August 1881."
Essays of Michel de Montaigne â€” Complete,Michel de Montaigne,"Being in this extremity, he frequently called me, merely to satisfy him that I was at his side. At length, he composed himself a little to rest, which strengthened our hopes; so much so, indeed, that I left the room, and went to rejoice thereupon with Mademoiselle de la Boetie. But, an hour or so afterwards, he called me by name once or twice, and then with a long sigh expired at three oâ€™clock on Wednesday morning, the 18th August 1563, having lived thirty-two years, nine months, and seventeen days. Monseigneur, I pray God to grant you a very long and happy life."
Old Granny Fox,Thornton W. Burgess,"Old Granny Fox was dreaming. Yes, Sir, she was dreaming. There she lay, curled up on the sunny little knoll on the edge of the Green Forest, fast asleep and dreaming. It was a very pleasant and very comfortable place indeed. You see, jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun poured his warmest rays right down there from the blue, blue sky. When Old Granny Fox was tired, she often slipped over there for a short nap and sun-bath even in winter. She was quite sure that no one knew anything about it. It was one of her secrets. This morning Old Granny Fox was very tired, unusually so."
Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin,Benjamin Franklin,"Father Abraham in his study 330 The end papers show, at the front, the Franklin arms and the Franklin seal; at the back, the medal given by the Boston public schools from the fund left by Franklin for that purpose as provided in the following extract from his will: ""I was born in Boston, New England, and owe my first instructions in literature to the free grammar-schools established there. I therefore give one hundred pounds sterling to my executors, to be by them ... paid over to the managers or directors of the free schools in my native town of Boston, to be by them ..."
The Art of War,active 6th century B.C. Sunzi,"Making some allowance for the exuberance of friendship, I am inclined to endorse this favorable judgment, and would certainly place him above Châ€™en Hao in order of merit. The following is an extract from the ""Impartial Judgments in the Garden of Literature"" by Cheng Hou:â€” Chu Hsi, commenting on this, fully admits the first part of the criticism, although he dislikes the audacious comparison with the venerated classical works. Language of this sort, he says, ""encourages a ruler's bent towards unrelenting warfare and reckless militarism."" Accustomed as we are to think of China as the greatest peace-loving nation on earth, we are in some danger of forgetting that her experience of war in all its phases has also been such as no modern State can parallel."
Siddhartha,Hermann Hesse,"This myth, this rumour, this legend resounded, its fragrance rose up, here and there; in the towns, the Brahmans spoke of it and in the forest, the Samanas; again and again, the name of Gotama, the Buddha reached the ears of the young men, with good and with bad talk, with praise and with defamation. It was as if the plague had broken out in a country and news had been spreading around that in one or another place there was a man, a wise man, a knowledgeable one, whose word and breath was enough to heal everyone who had been infected with the pestilence, and as such news would go through the land and everyone would talk about it, many would believe, many would doubt, but many would get on their way as soon as possible, to seek the wise man, the helper, just like this myth ran through the land, that fragrant myth of Gotama, the Buddha, the wise man of the family of Sakya. He possessed, so the believers said, the highest enlightenment, he remembered his previous lives, he had reached the nirvana and never returned into the cycle, was never again submerged in the murky river of physical forms."
Persuasion,Jane Austen,"Captain Wentworth had no fortune. He had been lucky in his profession; but spending freely, what had come freely, had realized nothing. But he was confident that he should soon be rich: full of life and ardour, he knew that he should soon have a ship, and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted. He had always been lucky; he knew he should be so still. Such confidence, powerful in its own warmth, and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it, must have been enough for Anne; but Lady Russell saw it very differently. His sanguine temper, and fearlessness of mind, operated very differently on her."
Sense and Sensibility,Jane Austen,"Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister. She could not consider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it. There was, at times, a want of spirits about him which, if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost as unpromising. A doubt of her regard, supposing him to feel it, need not give him more than inquietude. It would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him. A more reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the indulgence of his affection. She knew that his mother neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present, nor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself, without strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement."
An Index of The Divine Comedy,Dante,"Noon's fervid hour perchance six thousand miles From hence is distant; and the shadowy cone Almost to level on our earth declines; When from the midmost of this blue abyss By turns some star is to our vision lost. And straightway as the handmaid of the sun Puts forth her radiant brow, all, light by light, Fade, and the spangled firmament shuts in, E'en to the loveliest of the glittering throng. Thus vanish'd gradually from my sight The triumph, which plays ever round the point, That overcame me, seeming (for it did) Engirt by that it girdeth. Wherefore love, With loss of other object, forc'd me bend Mine eyes on Beatrice once again."

Oliver Twist,Charles Dickens,"â€œPlease, sir, I want some more.â€ The master was a fat, healthy man; but he turned very pale. He gazed in stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds, and then clung for support to the copper. The assistants were paralysed with wonder; the boys with fear. â€œWhat!â€ said the master at length, in a faint voice. â€œPlease, sir,â€ replied Oliver, â€œI want some more.â€ The master aimed a blow at Oliverâ€™s head with the ladle; pinioned him in his arm; and shrieked aloud for the beadle. The board were sitting in solemn conclave, when Mr. Bumble rushed into the room in great excitement, and addressing the gentleman in the high chair, said,"
The Problems of Philosophy,Bertrand Russell,"We shall say that we have acquaintance with anything of which we are directly aware, without the intermediary of any process of inference or any knowledge of truths. Thus in the presence of my table I am acquainted with the sense-data that make up the appearance of my tableâ€”its colour, shape, hardness, smoothness, etc.; all these are things of which I am immediately conscious when I am seeing and touching my table. The particular shade of colour that I am seeing may have many things said about itâ€”I may say that it is brown, that it is rather dark, and so on."
The Confessions of St. Augustine,Bishop of Hippo Saint Augustine,"Therefore I fell among men proudly doting, exceeding carnal and prating, in whose mouths were the snares of the Devil, limed with the mixture of the syllables of Thy name, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Ghost, the Paraclete, our Comforter. These names departed not out of their mouth, but so far forth as the sound only and the noise of the tongue, for the heart was void of truth. Yet they cried out ""Truth, Truth,"" and spake much thereof to me, yet it was not in them: but they spake falsehood, not of Thee only (who truly art Truth), but even of those elements of this world, Thy creatures."
Notes from the Underground,Fyodor Dostoyevsky,"""Why must you invariably be the first to move aside?"" I kept asking myself in hysterical rage, waking up sometimes at three o'clock in the morning. ""Why is it you and not he? There's no regulation about it; there's no written law. Let the making way be equal as it usually is when refined people meet; he moves half-way and you move half-way; you pass with mutual respect."" But that never happened, and I always moved aside, while he did not even notice my making way for him. And lo and behold a bright idea dawned upon me! ""What,"" I thought, ""if I meet him and don't move on one side? What if I don't move aside on purpose, even if I knock up against him? How would that be?"" This audacious idea took such a hold on me that it gave me no peace."
Complete Original Short Stories of Guy De Maupassant,Guy de Maupassant,"A STUDY BY POL. NEVEUX He undertook to write the article for the Gaulois and, in cooperation with his friends, he worded it in the terms with which we are familiar, amplifying and embellishing it, yielding to an inborn taste for mystification which his youth rendered excusable. The essential point, he said, is to â€œunmoorâ€ criticism. It was unmoored. The following day Wolff wrote a polemical dissertation in the Figaro and carried away his colleagues. The volume was a brilliant success, thanks to Boule de Suif. Despite the novelty, the honesty of effort, on the part of all, no mention was made of the other stories."
Ethan Frome,Edith Wharton,"â€œCome in,â€ he said; and as he spoke the droning voice grew still... It was that night that I found the clue to Ethan Frome, and began to put together this vision of his story. The village lay under two feet of snow, with drifts at the windy corners. In a sky of iron the points of the Dipper hung like icicles and Orion flashed his cold fires. The moon had set, but the night was so transparent that the white house-fronts between the elms looked gray against the snow, clumps of bushes made black stains on it, and the basement windows of the church sent shafts of yellow light far across the endless undulations."
Narrative of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson,Rowlandson,"A comfortable remove it was to me, because of my hopes. They gave me a pack, and along we went cheerfully; but quickly my will proved more than my strength; having little or no refreshing, my strength failed me, and my spirits were almost quite gone. Now may I say with David ""I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me. I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down like the locust; my knees are weak through fasting, and my flesh faileth of fatness"" (Psalm 119.22-24). At night we came to an Indian town, and the Indians sat down by a wigwam discoursing, but I was almost spent, and could scarce speak."
The Elements of Style,William Strunk,"It is nearly half past five. We cannot reach town before dark. If a conjunction is inserted the proper mark is a comma (Rule 4). Stevenson's romances are entertaining, for they are full of exciting adventures. It is nearly half past five, and we cannot reach town before dark. A comparison of the three forms given above will show clearly the advantage of the first. It is, at least in the examples given, better than the second form, because it suggests the close relationship between the two statements in a way that the second does not attempt, and better than the third, because briefer and therefore more forcible."
"Songs of Innocence, and Songs of Experience",William Blake,"58 The Human Abstract 59 Infant Sorrow 61 A Poison Tree 62 A Little Boy Lost 63 A Little Girl Lost 65 A Divine Image 67 A Cradle Song 68 The Schoolboy 69 To Tirzah 71 The Voice of the Ancient Bard 72 Piping down the valleys wild, Piping songs of pleasant glee, On a cloud I saw a child, And he laughing said to me: â€˜Pipe a song about a Lamb!â€™ So I piped with merry cheer. â€˜Piper, pipe that song again.â€™ So I piped: he wept to hear. â€˜Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe; Sing thy songs of happy cheer!â€™ So I sung the same again, While he wept with joy to hear."
Pygmalion,Bernard Shaw,"Titterings. Popular interest in the note takerâ€™s performance increases. THE FLOWER GIRL. Let him say what he likes. I donâ€™t want to have no truck with him. THE BYSTANDER. You take us for dirt under your feet, donâ€™t you? Catch you taking liberties with a gentleman! THE SARCASTIC BYSTANDER. Yes: tell HIM where he come from if you want to go fortune-telling. THE NOTE TAKER. Cheltenham, Harrow, Cambridge, and India. THE NOTE TAKER. Iâ€™ve thought of that. Perhaps I shall some day. The rain has stopped; and the persons on the outside of the crowd begin to drop off. THE NOTE TAKER. Did I say that out loud? I didnâ€™t mean to."
"The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, Or Gustavus Vassa, The",,"On the 21st of April we renewed our efforts to land the men, while all the men of war were stationed along the shore to cover it, and fired at the French batteries and breastworks from early in the morning till about four o'clock in the evening, when our soldiers effected a safe landing. They immediately attacked the French; and, after a sharp encounter, forced them from the batteries. Before the enemy retreated they blew up several of them, lest they should fall into our hands. Our men now proceeded to besiege the citadel, and my master was ordered on shore to superintend the landing of all the materials necessary for carrying on the siege; in which service I mostly attended him."
Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog),Jerome K. Jerome,"Three weeks afterwards, I met him in the coffee-room of a Bath hotel, talking about his voyages, and explaining, with enthusiasm, how he loved the sea. â€œGood sailor!â€ he replied in answer to a mild young manâ€™s envious query; â€œwell, I did feel a little queer once, I confess. It was off Cape Horn. The vessel was wrecked the next morning.â€ I said: â€œWerenâ€™t you a little shaky by Southend Pier one day, and wanted to be thrown overboard?â€ â€œSouthend Pier!â€ he replied, with a puzzled expression. â€œYes; going down to Yarmouth, last Friday three weeks.â€ â€œOh, ahâ€”yes,â€ he answered, brightening up; â€œI remember now."
The Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe,Daniel Defoe,"This was game indeed to us, but this was no food; and I was very sorry to lose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature that was good for nothing to us. However, Xury said he would have some of him; so he comes on board, and asked me to give him the hatchet. â€œFor what, Xury?â€ said I. â€œMe cut off his head,â€ said he. However, Xury could not cut off his head, but he cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and it was a monstrous great one. I bethought myself, however, that, perhaps the skin of him might, one way or other, be of some value to us; and I resolved to take off his skin if I could."
