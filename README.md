# MSA 2021 Phase 2 Data Science

* Files for the model deployment and training can be found in the 'deployment-files' folder
* Files for web scraping on Project Gutenberg can be found in the 'gutenberg-scrape' folder
* Source files for the chatbot can be found in the 'commonlit_bot' folder
* Reports can be found int he 'reports' folder

Link to the chatbot hosted on Telegram: [https://t.me/Commonlit_Bot](https://t.me/Commonlit_Bot)

*Note:* Chatbot may not start locally but functions properly as Azure Bot Service. Failure to start locally occurred after the bot was successfully published. Deleting the files in 'bin' directory of 'commonlit_bot' appears to fix the issue.
